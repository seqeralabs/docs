Use Fusion directly in Seqera Platform compute environments, or add Fusion to your Nextflow pipeline configuration.

### Seqera Platform

Use Fusion directly in the following Seqera Platform compute environments:
- [AWS Batch](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/compute-envs/aws-batch)
- [Azure Batch](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/compute-envs/azure-batch)
- [Google Cloud Batch](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/compute-envs/google-cloud-batch)
- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/compute-envs/eks)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/compute-envs/gke)

See the Platform compute environment page for your cloud provider for Fusion configuration instructions and optimal compute and storage recommendations. 

### Nextflow

:::note
Fusion requires Nextflow `22.10.0` or later.
:::

Fusion integrates with Nextflow directly and does not require any installation or change in pipeline code. It only requires to use of a container runtime or a container computing service such as Kubernetes, AWS Batch, or Google Cloud Batch.

#### Nextflow installation

If you already have Nextflow installed, update to the latest version using this command:

```bash
nextflow -self-update
```

Otherwise, install Nextflow with this command:

```bash
curl get.nextflow.io | bash
```

#### Fusion configuration

To enable Fusion in your Nextflow pipeline, add the following snippet to your `nextflow.config` file:

```groovy
fusion.enabled = true
wave.enabled = true
tower.accessToken = '<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>' //optional
```

Replace `<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your Platform access token.

:::tip
The use of the Platform access token is not mandatory, however, it's required to enable access to private repositories
and it allows higher service rate limits compared to anonymous users.
