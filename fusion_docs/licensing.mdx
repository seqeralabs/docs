**Note: Fusion licensing requirements and free tier quota will be enforced starting June 30th, 2025. Please [contact Seqera](https://seqera.io/contact-us) with any questions or licensing requests.**

A Fusion license allows you to use Fusion within a specific quota as measured by total throughput per month (defined by [Nextflow’s I/O metrics](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/metrics.html#i-o-usage)).

## For Seqera Cloud 

- Seqera Platform will automatically add and manage a Fusion license on your behalf, up to the allowed quota of usage. Seqera Platform will track Fusion usage for all pipelines run within the Platform.
- The default quota for free use within Seqera Cloud is 100TB.
- Once your quota is met/exceeded, you will be prevented from running additional Nextflow pipelines leveraging Fusion.

## For Seqera Enterprise instances with connectivity to Seqera’s license server

- Seqera Platform will automatically add and manage a Fusion license on your behalf, up to the allowed quota of usage. Seqera Platform will track Fusion usage for all pipelines run within the Platform.
- Once your quota is met or exceeded, you will be prevented from running additional Nextflow pipelines leveraging Fusion.

## For Seqera Enterprise instances without network connectivity and direct use with Nextflow
