:::info
Fusion licensing requirements and free tier quotas will be enforced starting June 30th, 2025. [Contact Seqera](https://seqera.io/contact-us) with any questions or licensing requests.
:::

A Fusion license sets a specific quota for Fusion use, measured by total throughput per month (defined by [Nextflow’s I/O metrics](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/metrics.html#i-o-usage)).

## For Seqera Cloud 

- Seqera Platform will automatically add and manage a Fusion license on your behalf, up to the allowed usage quota. Seqera will track Fusion use for all pipelines run in Platform.
- The default quota for free use within Seqera Cloud is 100TB.
- Once your quota is met or exceeded, you will be prevented from running additional Nextflow pipelines with Fusion.

## For Seqera Enterprise instances with connectivity to Seqera’s license server

- Seqera Platform will automatically add and manage a Fusion license on your behalf, up to the allowed usage quota. Seqera will track Fusion use for all pipelines run in Platform.
- Once your quota is met or exceeded, you will be prevented from running additional Nextflow pipelines with Fusion.

## For Seqera Enterprise instances without network connectivity, and direct Fusion use with Nextflow  

[Contact Seqera](https://seqera.io/contact-us) for a license that can be integrated into your workflow, or to set up an evaluation.
