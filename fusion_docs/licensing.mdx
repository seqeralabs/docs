You need a license to use the Fusion file system and the license is bundled with your Seqera Enterprise license. Additionally, if you have a Studios license, you don't need a Fusion license to use Fusion with your studios. All Studios templates include Fusion.

From Fusion 2.4.7 license enforcement is applied.

## License management 

### Seqera Cloud

If you are a Cloud customer, your license entitlement for Fusion is managed by Seqera.

### Seqera Enterprise

If you are an Enterprise customer, you can use Fusion in both networked and air-gapped environments.

### Nextflow integration

Fusion file system requires the use of Seqera Platform. Ensure that you either add `tower.accessToken` to your config, or define the `TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable  in your launch environment.

For Nextflow pipeline runs with Fusion enabled, Nextflow requests from Platform Enterprise a short-lived JWT containing the license key for Fusion. By using a short-lived token, pipeline runs do not need to initiate any outbound network connections to Seqera. The JWT is contained in the `FUSION_LICENSE_TOKEN` in the executing pipeline environment.

For more information on using Fusion with Nextflow, see [Get started][get-started].

## License renewal

If your Platform installation has network access, license renewal occurs daily automatically. The following diagram illustrates the license renewal workflow.

If your Platform installation is air-gapped, Seqera renews your license on an annual basis and provides a license certificate. The following diagram illustrates the license renewal workflow.
