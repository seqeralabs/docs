Use of the Fusion file system requires a license. [Contact Seqera](https://seqera.io/contact-us/) for more details.

Your Fusion license is bundled with your Seqera Enterprise license.

If you have a Data Studios license, you do not need a Fusion license to use Fusion with your studios. All Data Studios templates include Fusion.

For Nextflow pipeline runs, Platform generates a short-lived JWT for Fusion. By using a short-lived token, pipeline runs do not need to initiate any outbound network connections to Seqera. The JWT is contained in the `FUSION_LICENSE_TOKEN` in the executing pipeline environment. License checks occur when a pipeline run starts, and execution is never interrupted if license expiration happens during a run.

## Seqera Cloud

If you are a Cloud customer, your license entitlement for Fusion is managed by Seqera.

## Seqera Enterprise

If you are an Enterprise customer, use of Fusion is supported in both networked and air-gapped environments. Each approach necessitates a different license renewal workflow.

### License renewal for networked environments

If your Platform installation has network access, license renewal occurs daily automatically. The following diagram illustrates the license renewal workflow.

### License renewal for air-gapped environments

If your Platform installation is air-gapped, license renewal is handled manually, with Seqera supplying you with an updated license certificate annually. The following diagram illustrates the license renewal workflow.
