Use Fusion directly in Seqera Platform compute environments, or add Fusion to your Nextflow pipeline configuration.

## Seqera Platform

Use Fusion directly in the following Seqera Platform compute environments:

- [AWS Batch](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/aws-batch)
- [Azure Batch](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/azure-batch)
- [Google Cloud Batch](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/google-cloud-batch)
- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/eks)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/gke)

See the Platform compute environment page for your cloud provider for Fusion configuration instructions and optimal compute and storage recommendations.

## Nextflow

Fusion integrates seamlessly with Nextflow and requires no installation or pipeline code changes.

This section describes how to enable Fusion in your Nextflow pipelines. It includes:

- Creating a Seqera access token.
- Configuring Fusion in your pipeline.
- Running your Nextflow pipeline with Fusion.

:::info[Prerequisites]
You will need the following to get started:

- Nextflow 22.10.0 or later installed locally. See [Updating Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/updating-nextflow.html) to update.
- A Seqera account.
- A container runtime or container computing service, for example, Kubernetes, AWS Batch, or Google Cloud Batch.

:::

### Create your Seqera access token

A Seqera access token is your personal authentication key that enables access to Seqera Platform services.

To create a Seqera access token:

1. Log in to [Seqera](https://cloud.seqera.io/login).
2. From your personal workspace: Go to the user menu and select **Settings > Your tokens**.
3. Select **Add token**.
4. Enter a unique name for your token, then select **Add**.
5. Copy and store your token securely.

:::caution
The access token is displayed only once. Save the token value before you close the **Personal Access Token** window.
:::

### Configure Fusion in your pipeline

To enable Fusion in your Nextflow pipeline, add the following to your `nextflow.config` file:

```groovy
fusion.enabled = true
wave.enabled = true
tower.accessToken = '<TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

Replace `<TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your Seqera access token.

:::tip
See [Configuration options](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/config.html) for a full list of Nextflow configuration options.
:::

### Run your Nextflow pipeline

To run your pipeline with Fusion enabled, execute your Nextflow command as usual. For example:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf
```

Fusion will automatically provision and mount your pipeline storage.
