With Fusion, you can run Nextflow pipelines using the local executor and MinIO, an open source, enterprise grade, object storage compatible with AWS S3. This
is useful to scale your pipeline execution vertically with a large compute instance, without the need to allocate
a large storage volume for temporary pipeline data.

### Nextflow CLI

Nextflow and Fusion can use Minio (or other S3-compatible object storages) as an alternative to AWS S3 in some deployment scenarios.

:::tip
This configuration requires Docker or a similar container engine to run pipeline tasks.
:::

1. Run a local instance of MinIO using Docker:

    ```
    docker run -p 9000:9000 \
    --rm -d -p 9001:9001 \
    -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin" \
    -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret" \
    quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
    ```

1. Open the MinIO console `http://localhost:9001`

1. Create storage credentials and a bucket.

1. Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables to grant Nextflow and Fusion access to your storage credentials. See [Credentials](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/google.html#credentials) for more information.

1. Add the following to your `nextflow.config` file:

    ```groovy
    wave.enabled = true
    docker.enabled = true
    tower.accessToken = '<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
    fusion.enabled = true
    fusion.exportStorageCredentials = true
    aws.client.endpoint = 'http://localhost:9000'
    aws.client.s3PathStyleAccess = true
    ```

    Replace `<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your Platform access token.

1. Run the pipeline with the Nextflow run command:

    ```
    nextflow run <PIPELINE_SCRIPT> -w s3://<S3_BUCKET>/work
    ```

    Replace the following:
    - `PIPELINE_SCRIPT` with your pipeline Git repository URI.
    - `S3_BUCKET` with your S3 bucket name.

:::tip
To achieve optimal performance, set up an SSD volume as the temporary directory.
:::

:::warning
The option `fusion.exportStorageCredentials` leaks credentials on the task launcher script created by Nextflow.
This option should only be used for testing and development purposes.
