With Fusion, you can run Nextflow pipelines using the local executor and AWS S3. This
is useful to scale your pipeline execution vertically with a large compute instance, without the need to allocate
a large storage volume for temporary pipeline data.

### Nextflow CLI

:::tip
This configuration requires Docker or a similar container engine to run pipeline tasks.
:::

1. Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables to grant Nextflow and Fusion access to your storage credentials. See [Credentials](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/google.html#credentials) for more information.

1. Add the following to your `nextflow.config` file:

    ```groovy
    wave.enabled = true
    docker.enabled = true
    tower.accessToken = '<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
    fusion.enabled = true
    fusion.exportStorageCredentials = true
    ```

    Replace `<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your Platform access token.

1. Run the pipeline with the Nextflow run command:

    ```
    nextflow run <PIPELINE_SCRIPT> -w s3://<S3_BUCKET>/work
    ```

    Replace the following:
    - `<PIPELINE_SCRIPT>` with your pipeline Git repository URI.
    - `<S3_BUCKET>` with your S3 bucket name.

:::tip
To achieve optimal performance, set up an SSD volume as the temporary directory.
:::

:::warning
The option `fusion.exportStorageCredentials` leaks credentials on the task launcher script created by Nextflow.
This option should only be used for testing and development purposes.
