Fusion streamlines the deployment of Nextflow pipelines in Kubernetes because it replaces the need to configure
and maintain a shared file system in your cluster.

### Platform Amazon EKS compute environments 

Seqera Platform supports Fusion in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) compute environments. 

See [Amazon EKS](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/eks) for Platform instructions to enable Fusion.

### Nextflow CLI

:::tip
Fusion file system implements a lazy download and upload algorithm that runs in the background to transfer files in
parallel to and from the object storage into the container-local temporary directory (`/tmp`). To achieve optimal performance, set up an SSD volume as the temporary directory.

Several AWS EC2 instance types include one or more NVMe SSD volumes. These volumes must be formatted to be used. See [SSD instance storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html) for details.
:::

To use Fusion directly in Nextflow with an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure a namespace and service account and update your Nextflow configuration. 

#### Kubernetes configuration

Create a namespace and a service account in your Kubernetes cluster to run the jobs submitted during pipeline execution.

1. Create a manifest that includes the following configuration. For example:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
        name: fusion-demo
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
        namespace: fusion-demo
        name: fusion-sa
        annotations:
            eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/fusion-demo-role"
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
        namespace: fusion-demo
        name: fusion-role
    rules:
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["pods", "pods/status", "pods/log", "pods/exec"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete"]
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
        namespace: fusion-demo
        name: fusion-rolebind
    roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: Role
        name: fusion-role
    subjects:
        - kind: ServiceAccount
          name: fusion-sa
    ```

    Replace `<ACCOUNT_ID>` with your account ID.

1. Configure your AWS IAM role to provide read-write permission to the S3 bucket used as the pipeline work directory. For example:

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
                "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET>"]
            },
            {
                "Action": [
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:PutObject",
                    "s3:PutObjectTagging",
                    "s3:DeleteObject"
                ],
                "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET>/*"],
                "Effect": "Allow"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    Replace `<S3_BUCKET>` with your bucket name.

1. Define a role trust relationship. For example:

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/id/<CLUSTER_ID>"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                        "oidc.eks.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/<CLUSTER_ID>:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
                        "oidc.eks.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/<CLUSTER_ID>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:fusion-demo:fusion-sa"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    Replace the following:
    - `<ACCOUNT_ID>`: AWS account ID
    - `<REGION>`: AWS region
    - `<CLUSTER_ID>`: cluster ID

#### Nextflow configuration

1. Add the following to your `nextflow.config` file:

    ```groovy
    process.executor = 'k8s'
    wave.enabled = true
    fusion.enabled = true
    tower.accessToken = '<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
    k8s.context = '<K8S_CLUSTER_CONTEXT>'
    k8s.namespace = 'fusion-demo'
    k8s.serviceAccount = 'fusion-sa'
    ```

    Replace the following:
    - `<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>`: your Platform access token.
    - `<K8S_CLUSTER_CONTEXT>`: your Kubernetes context.

1. Run the pipeline with the Nextflow run command:

    ```
    nextflow run <YOUR PIPELINE SCRIPT> -w s3://<S3_BUCKET>/work
    ```

    Replace the following:
    - `<PIPELINE_SCRIPT>`: your pipeline Git repository URI.
    - `<S3_BUCKET>`: your S3 bucket.

:::note
When using Fusion, pods will run as privileged by default.
:::

To use Fusion without the need for escalating privileges, install the Nextflow [FUSE device plugin](https://github.com/nextflow-io/k8s-fuse-plugin) on your Kubernetes cluster and add set `fusion.privileged` to `false` in your `nextflow.config` file:

```
fusion.privileged = false
```

To use a custom FUSE device plugin, specify it via the `k8s.fuseDevicePlugin` configuration option. See [Kubernetes](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/config.html#k8s) configuration options for details.
