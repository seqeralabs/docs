Fusion simplifies and improves the efficiency of Nextflow pipelines in [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) in several ways:

- No need to use the AWS CLI tool for copying data to and from S3 storage.
- No need to create a custom AMI or create custom containers to include the AWS CLI tool.
- Fusion uses an efficient data transfer and caching algorithm that provides much faster throughput compared to AWS CLI and does not require a local copy of data files.
- By replacing the AWS CLI with a native API client, the transfer is much more robust at scale.

### Platform AWS Batch compute environments 

Seqera Platform supports Fusion in Batch Forge and manual AWS Batch compute environments. 

See [AWS Batch](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/aws-batch) for compute and storage recommendations and instructions to enable Fusion.

### Nextflow CLI

:::tip
Fusion file system implements a lazy download and upload algorithm that runs in the background to transfer files in
parallel to and from the object storage and container-local temporary directory (`/tmp`).

Several AWS EC2 instance types include one or more NVMe SSD volumes. These volumes must be formatted to be used. See [SSD instance storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html) for details.

Seqera Platform automatically formats and configures NVMe instance storage with the **Fast instance storage** option when you create an AWS Batch compute environment.
:::

1. Add the following to your `nextflow.config` file:

    ```groovy
    process.executor = 'awsbatch'
    process.queue = '<AWS_BATCH_QUEUE>'
    process.scratch = false
    process.containerOptions = '-v <PATH_TO_SSD>:/tmp' // Required for SSD volumes
    wave.enabled = true
    fusion.enabled = true
    tower.accessToken = '<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
    aws.region = '<AWS_REGION>'
    ```

    Replace the following:
    - `<AWS_BATCH_QUEUE>`: the path to your AWS Batch queue.
    - `<PATH_TO_SSD>` with your SSD path.
    - `<PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>`: your Platform access token.


1. Run the pipeline with the Nextflow run command:

    ```
    nextflow run <PIPELINE_SCRIPT> -w s3://<S3_BUCKET>/work
    ```

    Replace the following:
    - `<PIPELINE_SCRIPT>`: your pipeline Git repository URI.
    - `<S3_BUCKET>`: your S3 bucket.

:::tip
You can use an EBS gp3 volume with a throughput of 325 MiB/s (or more) and a size of 100 GiB (or larger) as an alternative to configuring NVMe storage on your compute node. While slower than NVMe storage, this configuration provides sufficient performance for many workloads.

### IAM permissions

Configure with the following IAM permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET>"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET>/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace `<S3_BUCKET>` with your S3 bucket name.
