import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

:::note
The CLI performs operations in the user workspace context by default. Use the `TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID` environment variable or the `--workspace` parameter to specify an organization workspace ID.
:::

Use the `-h` or `--help` parameter to list the available commands and their associated options.

[![`tw --help`](./_images/tw-info.jpg)](https://github.com/seqeralabs/tower-cli)

For help with a specific subcommand, run the command with `-h` or `--help` appended. For example, `tw credentials add google -h`.

:::tip
Use `tw --output=json <command>` to dump and store Seqera Platform entities in JSON format.

Use `tw --output=json <command> | jq -r '.[].<key>'`  to pipe the command to use jq to retrieve specific values in the JSON output. For example, `tw --output=json workspaces list | jq -r '.workspaces[].orgId'` returns the organization ID for each workspace listed.
:::

## Credentials

To launch pipelines in a Platform workspace, you need [credentials][credentials] for:

1. Compute environments
2. Pipeline repository Git providers
3. (Optional) [Tower agent][tower-agent] â€” used with HPC clusters
4. (Optional) Container registries, such as docker.io

### Add credentials

Run `tw credentials add -h` to view a list of providers.

Run `tw credentials add <provider> -h` to view the required fields for your provider.

:::note
You can add multiple credentials from the same provider in the same workspace.
:::

#### Compute environment credentials

Platform requires credentials to access your cloud compute environments. See the [compute environment page][compute-envs] for your cloud provider for more information.

```bash
tw credentials add aws --name=my_aws_creds --access-key=<aws access key> --secret-key=<aws secret key>

  New AWS credentials 'my_aws_creds (1sxCxvxfx8xnxdxGxQxqxH)' added at user workspace
```

#### Git credentials

Platform requires access credentials to interact with pipeline Git repositories. See [Git integration][git-integration] for more information.

```bash
tw credentials add github -n=my_GH_creds -u=<GitHub username> -p=<GitHub access token>

  New GITHUB credentials 'my_GH_creds (xxxxx3prfGlpxxxvR2xxxxo7ow)' added at user workspace
```

#### Container registry credentials

Configure credentials for the Nextflow Wave container service to authenticate to private and public container registries. See the **Container registry credentials** section under [Credentials][credentials] for registry-specific instructions.

:::note
Container registry credentials are only used by the Wave container service. See [Wave containers][wave-docs] for more information.
:::

### List credentials

```bash
tw credentials list

  Credentials at user workspace:

    ID                     | Provider  | Name                               | Last activity                 
    ------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------
    1x1HxFxzxNxptxlx4xO7Gx | aws       | my_aws_creds_1                     | Wed, 6 Apr 2022 08:40:49 GMT  
    1sxCxvxfx8xnxdxGxQxqxH | aws       | my_aws_creds_2                     | Wed, 9 Apr 2022 08:40:49 GMT  
    2x7xNsf2xkxxUIxXKxsTCx | ssh       | my_ssh_key                         | Thu, 8 Jul 2021 07:09:46 GMT  
    4xxxIeUx7xex1xqx1xxesk | github    | my_github_cred                     | Wed, 22 Jun 2022 09:18:05 GMT 
```

### Delete credentials

```bash
tw credentials delete --name=my_aws_creds

  Credentials '1sxCxvxfx8xnxdxGxQxqxH' deleted at user workspace
```

## Compute environments

Compute environments define the execution platform where a pipeline runs. A compute environment is composed of the credentials, configuration, and storage options related to a particular computing platform.  See [Compute environments][compute-envs] for more information on supported providers.

Run `tw compute-envs -h` to view the list of supported compute environment operations.

### Add a compute environment

Run `tw compute-envs add -h` to view the list of supported providers.

Run `tw compute-envs add <platform> -h` to view the required and optional fields for your provider.

You must add the credentials for your provider before creating your compute environment.

```bash
tw compute-envs add aws-batch forge --name=my_aws_ce \
--credentials=<my_aws_creds_1> --region=eu-west-1 --max-cpus=256 \
--work-dir=s3://<bucket name> --wait=AVAILABLE

  New AWS-BATCH compute environment 'my_aws_ce' added at user workspace
```

This command will:

- Use **Batch Forge** to automatically manage the AWS Batch resource lifecycle (`forge`)
- Use the credentials previously added to the workspace (`--credentials`)
- Create the required AWS Batch resources in the AWS Ireland (`eu-west-1`) region
- Provision a maximum of 256 CPUs in the compute environment (`--max-cpus`)
- Use an existing S3 bucket to store the Nextflow work directory (`--work-dir`)
- Wait until the compute environment has been successfully created and is ready to use (`--wait`)

See the [compute environment][compute-envs] page for your provider for detailed information on Batch Forge and manual compute environment creation.

### Delete a compute environment

```bash
tw compute-envs delete --name=my_aws_ce

  Compute environment '1sxCxvxfx8xnxdxGxQxqxH' deleted at user workspace
```

### Default compute environment

Select a **primary** compute environment to be used by default in a workspace. You can override the workspace primary compute environment by explicitly specifying an alternative compute environment when you create or launch a pipeline.

```bash
tw compute-envs primary set --name=my_aws_ce

  Primary compute environment for workspace 'user' was set to 'my_aws_ce (1sxCxvxfx8xnxdxGxQxqxH)'  
```

### Import and export a compute environment

Export the configuration details of a compute environment in JSON format for scripting and reproducibility purposes.

```bash
tw compute-envs export --name=my_aws_ce my_aws_ce_v1.json

  Compute environment exported into 'my_aws_ce_v1.json' 
```

Similarly, a compute environment can be imported to a workspace from a previously exported JSON file.

```bash
tw compute-envs import --name=my_aws_ce_v1 ./my_aws_ce_v1.json

  New AWS-BATCH compute environment 'my_aws_ce_v1' added at user workspace
```

## Datasets

Run `tw datasets -h` to view the list of supported operations.

[Datasets](../data/datasets) are CSV (comma-separated values) and TSV (tab-separated values) files stored in a workspace, used as inputs during pipeline execution. The most commonly used datasets for Nextflow pipelines are samplesheets, where each row consists of a sample, the location of files for that sample (such as FASTQ files), and other sample details.

### Add a dataset 

Run `tw datasets add -h` to view the required and optional fields for adding a dataset.

Add a preconfigured dataset file to a workspace (include the `--header` flag if the first row of your samplesheet file is a header):

```bash
tw datasets add --name=samplesheet1 --header samplesheet_test.csv

Dataset 'samplesheet1' added at user workspace with id '60gGrD4I2Gk0TUpEGOj5Td'
```

:::note 
The maximum supported dataset file size is 10 MB.
:::

### Delete a dataset 

To delete a workspace dataset, specify either the dataset name (`-n` flag) or ID (`-i` flag):

```bash 
tw datasets delete -i 6tYMjGqCUJy6dEXNK9y8kh

Dataset '6tYMjGqCUJy6dEXNK9y8kh' deleted at 97652229034604 workspace
```

Studio 2aa60bb7 deleted at [community / showcase] workspace.
```

## Pipelines

Run `tw pipelines -h` to view the list of supported operations.

Pipelines define pre-configured workflows in a workspace. A pipeline consists of a workflow repository, launch parameters, and a compute environment.

### Add a pipeline

Run `tw pipelines add -h` to view the required and optional fields for adding your pipeline.

Add a pre-configured pipeline to the Launchpad:

```bash
tw pipelines add --name=my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline \
--params-file=my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline_params.yaml \
--config=<path/to/nextflow/conf/file> \
https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf

New pipeline 'my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline' added at user workspace
```

The optional `--params-file` flag is used to pass a set of default parameters that will be associated with the pipeline in the Launchpad.

The optional `--config` flag is used to pass a custom Nextflow configuration file â€” configuration values passed here override the same values in the default pipeline repository `nextflow.conf` file. When this flag is set, all configuration values specified in Platform pipeline or compute environment **Nextflow config** fields are ignored.

:::tip
The `params-file` or `--config` file must be a YAML or JSON file using [Nextflow configuration][nextflow-config] syntax.
:::

### Import and export a pipeline

Export the configuration details of a pipeline in JSON format for scripting and reproducibility purposes.

```bash
tw pipelines export --name=my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline_v1.json

  Pipeline exported into 'my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline_v1.json' 
```

Similarly, a pipeline can be imported to a workspace from a previously exported JSON file.

```bash
tw pipelines import --name=my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline_v1 ./my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline_v1.json

  New pipeline 'my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline_v1' added at user workspace
```

### Update a pipeline

The default launch parameters can be changed with the `update` command:

```bash
tw pipelines update --name=my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline \
--params-file=my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline_params_2.yaml
```

## Launch pipelines

Run `tw launch -h` to view supported launch options.

### Launch a preconfigured pipeline

If no custom parameters are passed via the CLI during launch, the defaults set for the pipeline in the Launchpad will be used.

:::note
tw CLI users are bound to the same user permissions that apply in the Platform UI. Launch users can launch pre-configured pipelines in the workspaces they have access to, but they cannot add or run new pipelines.
:::

```bash
tw launch my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline \
--config=<path/to/nextflow/conf/file> \


  Workflow 1XCXxX0vCX8xhx submitted at user workspace.

    https://cloud.seqera.io/user/user1/watch/1XCXxX0vCX8xhx
```

The optional `--config` flag is used to pass a custom Nextflow configuration file â€” configuration values passed here override the same values in the default pipeline repository `nextflow.conf` file. When this flag is set, all configuration values specified in Platform pipeline or compute environment **Nextflow config** fields are ignored.

When using `--wait`, `tw` can exit with one of two exit codes:

- `0`: When the run reaches the desired state.
- `1`: When the run reaches a state that makes it impossible to reach the desired state.

:::tip
Use `--wait=SUCCEEDED` if you want the command to wait until the pipeline execution is complete.
:::

### Launch a pipeline with custom parameters

To specify custom parameters during pipeline launch, specify a custom `--params-file`:

```bash
tw launch my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline --params-file=my_rnaseq_nf_pipeline_params_2.yaml

  Workflow 2XDXxX0vCX8xhx submitted at user workspace.

    https://cloud.seqera.io/user/user1/watch/2XDXxX0vCX8xhx
```

See [Nextflow configuration][nextflow-config] for more information.

### Launch an unsaved pipeline

The CLI can directly launch pipelines that have not been added to the Launchpad in a Platform workspace by using the full pipeline repository URL:

```bash
tw launch https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq \
--params-file=./custom_rnaseq_params.yaml \
--config=<path/to/nextflow/conf/file> \
--compute-env=my_aws_ce --revision 3.8.1 \
--profile=test,docker  

  Workflow 2XDXxX0vCX8xhx submitted at user workspace.

    https://cloud.seqera.io/user/user1/watch/2XDXxX0vCX8xhx
```

- Pipeline parameters are defined within the `custom_rnaseq_params.yaml` file.
- The optional `--config` flag is used to pass a custom Nextflow configuration file â€” configuration values passed here override the same values in the default pipeline repository `nextflow.conf` file. When this flag is set, all configuration values specified in Platform pipeline or compute environment **Nextflow config** fields are ignored.
- Other parameters such as `--profile` and `--revision` can also be specified.
- A non-primary compute environment can be used to launch the pipeline. Omit `--compute-env` to launch with the workspace default compute environment.

:::note
CLI users are bound to the same user permissions that apply in the Platform UI. Launch users can launch pre-configured pipelines in the workspaces they have access to, but they cannot add or run new pipelines.
:::

## Runs

Run `tw runs -h` to view supported runs operations.  

Runs display all the current and previous pipeline runs in the specified workspace. Each new or resumed run is given a random name such as _grave_williams_ by default, which can be overridden with a custom value at launch. See [Run details](../monitoring/run-details) for more information. As a run executes, it can transition through the following states:

- `submitted`: Pending execution
- `running`: Running
- `succeeded`: Completed successfully
- `failed`: Successfully executed, where at least one task failed with a terminate [error strategy](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#errorstrategy)
- `cancelled`: Stopped manually during execution
- `unknown`: Indeterminate status

### View pipeline's runs

Run `tw runs view -h` to view all the required and optional fields for viewing a pipeline's runs.

```bash

Use the optional `--filter` flag to filter the list of runs returned by one or more `keyword:value` entries:

- `status`
- `label`
- `workflowId`
- `runName`
- `username`
- `projectName`
- `after`
- `before`
- `sessionId`
- `is:starred`

If no `keyword` is defined, the filtering is applied to the `runName`, `projectName` (the pipeline name), and `username`.

:::note
The `after` and `before` flags require an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) timestamp with UTC timezone (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ`).

Data-links allow you to work with public and private cloud storage buckets in [Data Explorer](../data/data-explorer) in the specified workspace. AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage are supported. The full list of operations are:

- `list`: List data-links in a workspace
- `add`: Add a custom data-link to a workspace
- `update`: Update a custom data-link in a workspace
- `delete`: Delete a custom data-link from a workspace
- `browse`: Browse the contents of a data-link in a workspace
- `upload`: Upload files and directories to a data-link in a workspace
- `download`: Download files and directories from a data-link in a workspace

### List data-links

Run `tw data-links list -h` to view all the optional fields for listing data-links in a workspace. 

If a workspace is not defined, the `TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID` workspace is used by default. data-links can be one of two types:

- `v1-cloud-<id>`: Cloud data-links auto-discovered using credentials attached to the workspace.
- `v1-user-<id>`: Custom data-links created by users.

```bash
tw data-links list -w seqeralabs/showcase
