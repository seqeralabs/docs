Platform supports resource labels in compute environments, pipelines, runs, and actions. This provides a flexible tagging system for annotating and tracking the cloud services consumed by a run. Resource labels are sent to the cloud service provider in `key=value` format.

Resource labels are applied to elements during:
- Compute environment creation
- Workflow submission
- Workflow execution

## Dynamic resource labels 

Dynamic resource labels extend the standard resource labels functionality by allowing variable values that are populated at runtime with unique workflow identifiers. This enables precise cost tracking and resource attribution for individual pipeline runs across cloud compute environments.

While standard resource labels use static key-value pairs like `project=research` or `environment=production`, dynamic resource labels use variable placeholders that get resolved when a workflow runs:

| Value           | Description         |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| `${workflowId}` | Platform run ID     |
| `${sessionId}`  | Nextflow session ID |

For example, a dynamic resource label `platformRun=${workflowId}` becomes `platformRun=12345abcde` when applied to the cloud resources consumed by run `12345abcde`.

Additional dynamic values, such as the user or team that launched a run, will be supported in a future release.

:::info
Because **dynamic resource labels** are used to tag resources with unique values corresponding to a pipeline run, they are only applied during workflow submission and execution time, and not during compute environment creation. See the **Submission time** and **Execution time** resources listed for each cloud provider on this page.
:::

### Benefits of dynamic resource labels

Dynamic resource labels provide several key advantages:

**Granular cost tracking**: Associate cloud costs with specific workflow runs rather than entire compute environments or projects.
**Automated attribution**: No manual tagging of individual runs - labels are applied automatically at execution time.
**Enhanced reporting**: Filter and group costs by individual workflow runs in your cloud provider's cost management tools.
**Audit trails**: Track resource usage patterns for specific workflows over time.

## Create resource labels

**Workspace-level labels**: Create resource labels at the workspace level for consistent use across compute environments, pipelines, runs, and actions:

1. Navigate to your workspace **Settings** > **Edit labels**.
2. Select **Edit** > **Add label**.
3. Enter a **Name** such as `owner`, `team`, or `platformRun`.
4. Enter a **Value**: 
  - **Standard resource labels**: `<your-username>`, `your-team-name`
  - **Dynamic resource labels**: Use variable syntax â€” `${workflowId}` or `${sessionId}`
5. Optionally, enable **Use as default in compute environment form** to automatically apply this label to all new compute environments in this workspace.
6. Select **Save**.

**Create labels during compute environment, pipeline, run, and action creation**: Standard and dynamic resource labels can also be created and added to new Platform entities on the fly.

The deletion of a resource label from a workspace has no influence on the cloud environment.

:::info
 All users can add resource labels, but only admins can edit or delete them, provided they're not already associated with **any** resource.
:::

## Apply resource labels

Once created at the workspace level, resource labels can be applied to:

- **Compute environments**: In the **Resource labels** field when creating a new compute environment. Once the compute environment has been created, its resource labels cannot be edited.
- **Pipelines**: In the **Resource labels** field when adding a new pipeline to the Launchpad.  
- **Pipeline runs**: In the **Resource labels** field when launching a pipeline. 
- **Actions**: In the **Resource labels** field when creating or editing an action.

Resource labels applied at the compute environment or pipeline level are prefilled in the pipeline launch form, and they can be applied or overridden during pipeline launch. Admins can override the default resource labels inherited from the compute environment when creating and editing pipelines, actions, and runs on the fly. The custom resource labels associated with each element will be propagated to the associated resources in your cloud provider account, without altering the default resource labels associated with the compute environment.

When an admin adds or edits the resource labels associated with a pipeline, action, or run, the **submission and execution time** resource labels are altered. This does not affect the resource labels for resources spawned at compute environment **creation time**.

For example, the resource label `name=ce1` is set during AWS Batch compute environment creation. If you create the resource label `pipeline=pipeline1` while launching a pipeline with the same AWS Batch compute environment, the EC2 instances associated with that compute environment will still contain only the `name=ce1` label, while the Job Definitions associated with the pipeline run will inherit the `pipeline=pipeline1` resource label.

If a maintainer changes the compute environment associated with a pipeline, the **Resource labels** field is updated with the resource labels from the new compute environment.

:::note
- Cloud provider credentials must have the appropriate roles or permissions to tag resources in your environment.
- You can't assign multiple resource labels, using the same key, to the same resource, regardless of whether this option is supported by the destination cloud provider.
:::

## Search and filter with resource labels

Search and filter pipelines and runs using one or more resource labels. The resource label search uses a `label:key=value` format.

## Resource label propagation to cloud environments

Resource labels are only available for cloud environments that use a resource tagging system. AWS, Azure, Google, and Kubernetes are supported. HPC compute environments do not support resource labels.

When a run is executed in a compute environment with associated resource labels:
- Seqera propagates the labels to the set of resources listed for each provider below.
- Nextflow distributes the labels for the resources spawned at runtime.

If the compute environment is created with Batch Forge, the compute environment will propagate the tags to the resources generated by the Forge execution.

:::caution
Resource label propagation is one-way and not synchronized with the cloud environment. This means that Seqera attaches tags to cloud resources, but isn't aware if those tags are changed or deleted directly in the cloud environment.
:::

## AWS

When the compute environment is created with Forge, the following resources will be tagged using the labels associated with the compute environment:

**Forge creation time**
- FSX Filesystems (does not cascade to files)
- EFS Filesystems (does not cascade to files)
- Batch Compute Environment
- Batch Queue(s)
- ComputeResource (EC2 instances, including EBS volumes)
- Service role
- Spot Fleet role
- Execution role
- Instance Profile role
- Launch template

**Submission time**
- Jobs and Job Definitions
- Tasks (via the `propagateTags` parameter on Job Definitions)

**Execution time**
- Work Tasks (via the `propagateTags` parameter on Job Definitions)

At execution time, when the jobs are submitted to Batch, the requests are set up to propagate tags to all the instances and volumes created by the head job.

The [`forge-policy.json` file](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-aws/blob/master/forge/forge-policy.json) contains the roles needed for Batch Forge-created AWS compute environments to tag AWS resources. Specifically, the required roles are `iam:TagRole`, `iam:TagInstanceProfile`, and `batch:TagResource`.

To view and manage the resource labels applied to AWS resources by Seqera and Nextflow, go to the [AWS Tag Editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/find-resources-to-tag.html) (as an administrative user) and follow these steps:

Under **Find resources to tag**, search for the resource label key and value in the relevant search fields under **Tags**. Your search can be further refined by AWS region and resource type. 
Select **Search resources**. **Resource search results** display all the resources tagged with your given resource label key and/or value.

### Include Seqera resource labels in AWS billing reports

To include the cost information associated with your resource labels in your AWS billing reports:

1. **Wait for tag creation**: After creating resources with resource labels, wait up to 24 hours for the tag keys to appear in your cost allocation tags page.

2. **Activate cost allocation tags**: [Activate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html) the associated tags in the **AWS Billing and Cost Management console**:
   - In the navigation pane, choose **Cost allocation tags**
   - Select the tag keys you want to activate
   - Choose **Activate**
   - Allow up to 24 hours for tags to activate

3. **Create cost allocation reports**: When your tags are activated and displayed in **Billing and Cost Management > Cost allocation tags**, you can apply them when you create [cost allocation reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/configurecostallocreport.html#allocation-viewing).

4. **View in Cost Explorer**: Navigate to AWS Cost Explorer and use **Group by** filters to organize costs by your activated tag keys.

### AWS limits
- Resource label keys and values must contain a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 39 alphanumeric characters (each), separated by dashes or underscores.
- The key and value cannot begin or end with dashes `-` or underscores `_`.
- The key and value cannot contain a consecutive combination of `-` or `_` characters (`--`, `__`, `-_`, etc.)
- A maximum of 25 resource labels can be applied to each resource.
- A maximum of 1000 resource labels can be used in each workspace.
- Keys and values cannot start with `aws` or `user`, as these are reserved prefixes appended to tags by AWS.
- Keys and values are case-sensitive in AWS.

See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#tag-restrictions) for more information on AWS resource tagging.

## Google Cloud

The following resources are tagged using the labels associated with the compute environment (either [Batch](../compute-envs/google-cloud-batch.md) or [Cloud](../compute-envs/google-cloud.md)):

**Submission time**
- Job (Batch)

**Execution time**
- AllocationPolicy (Batch)
- VirtualMachine (Cloud)

### View costs by resource labels in Google Cloud

Google Cloud includes resource labels in billing data, making them available for cost analysis and reporting:

1. **Access Billing Console**: Go to [Google Cloud Console > Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) and navigate to **Reports** in the Cost management section.

2. **Configure Reports**: Use the **Labels** filter to select specific label keys and set **Group by** to organize costs by your label values.

3. **Export for Analysis**:
   - [Enable Cloud Billing export to BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery) for detailed analysis and custom reporting.
   - Use tools like [Looker Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio/docs/overview) to visualize your labeled cost data.

### GCP limits

- Resource label keys and values must contain a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 39 alphanumeric characters (each), separated by dashes or underscores.
- The key and value cannot begin or end with dashes `-` or underscores `_`.
- The key and value cannot contain a consecutive combination of `-` or `_` characters (`--`, `__`, `-_`, etc.)
- A maximum of 25 resource labels can be applied to each resource.
- A maximum of 1000 resource labels can be used in each workspace.
- Keys and values in Google Cloud Resource Manager may contain only lowercase letters. Resource labels created with uppercase characters are converted to lowercase before being propagated to Google Cloud.

See [here](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements) for more information on Google Cloud Resource Manager labeling.

## Azure

:::note
The labeling system on Azure Cloud uses the term metadata to refer to resource and other labels.
:::

When creating an Azure Batch compute environment with Forge, resource labels are added to the Pool parameters â€” this adds set of `key=value` metadata pairs to the Azure Batch Pool.

:::warning
In Azure Batch compute environments, the [Azure Batch node pool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/nodes-and-pools) is managed by the compute environment and **resource labels are fixed at the time of creation**.
:::

### View costs by resource labels in Azure

Azure supports cost analysis by tags, but requires additional configuration for tag inheritance and cost allocation.

:::note
Dynamic resource labels create tags on Azure Batch resources, but Azure's cost reporting integration has some limitations. Azure tags may not always appear immediately in Cost Management.
:::

**Prerequisites**: Billing profile contributor/owner permissions for billing profile tags, and Contributor role or Tag Contributor role for resource tagging.

**Steps to enable cost tracking**:

1. **Enable Tag Inheritance** (recommended): Navigate to Cost Management in the Azure portal, select a billing account or subscription scope, and under Settings > **Configuration** > **Tag inheritance**, enable "Automatically apply subscription and resource group tags to new data". See [Azure tag inheritance documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/enable-tag-inheritance) for detailed steps.

2. **View Tagged Costs**: Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** > **Cost Management** > **Cost analysis** and select **Group by** for your tag key.

3. **Create Budgets with Tag Filters**: [Create budgets with filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets) on the inherited tags, available 24 hours after enabling tag inheritance.

### Azure limits

- Resource label keys and values must contain a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 39 alphanumeric characters (each), separated by dashes or underscores.
- The key and value cannot begin or end with dashes `-` or underscores `_`.
- The key and value cannot contain a consecutive combination of `-` or `_` characters (`--`, `__`, `-_`, etc.)
- A maximum of 25 resource labels can be applied to each resource.
- A maximum of 1000 resource labels can be used in each workspace.
- Keys are case-insensitive, but values are case-sensitive.
- Microsoft advises against using a non-English language in your resource labels, as this can lead to decoding progress failure while loading your VM's metadata.

Tags are not available for tenant resources not associated with subscriptions, classic resources, or some resource types that don't support tags in usage data.

See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources?tabs=json) for more information on Azure Resource Manager tagging.

## Kubernetes

Both the Head pod and Work pod specs will contain the set of labels associated with the compute environment in addition to the standard labels applied by Seqera Platform and Nextflow.

:::caution
Currently, tagging with resource labels is not available for the files created during a workflow execution. The cloud instances are the elements being tagged.
:::

The following resources will be tagged using the labels associated with the compute environment:

**Compute environment creation time**
- Deployment
- PodTemplate

**Submission time**
- Head Pod Metadata

**Execution time**
- Run Pod Metadata

### Kubernetes limits

- Resource label keys and values must contain a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 39 alphanumeric characters (each), separated by dashes or underscores.
- The key and value cannot begin or end with dashes `-` or underscores `_`.
- The key and value cannot contain a consecutive combination of `-` or `_` characters (`--`, `__`, `-_`, etc.)
- A maximum of 25 resource labels can be applied to each resource.
- A maximum of 1000 resource labels can be used in each workspace.

See [Syntax and character set](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set) for more information on Kubernetes object labeling.

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive keys**: Choose tag keys that clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., `workflow-id`, `pipeline-run`, `session-id`).
- **Plan for cost analysis**: Consider how you'll group and filter costs in your cloud provider's tools when designing your tag schema.
- **Combine static and dynamic labels**: Use dynamic resource labels alongside static labels for comprehensive cost attribution (e.g., static `project=genomics` with dynamic `platformRun=${workflowId}`).
- **Monitor tag limits**: Stay within cloud provider tag limits (25 tags per resource for AWS/GCP/Azure).
- **Document your schema**: Maintain documentation of your tagging strategy for team members who will analyze costs.

## Troubleshooting

**Tags not appearing in cost reports**: 
- Allow up to 24 hours for tags to appear in AWS cost allocation console
- For Azure, enable tag inheritance and allow 24 hours for processing
- Verify that resources are actively running and generating usage data

**Permission errors**: 
- Ensure compute environment credentials have the required tagging permissions
- For Google Cloud, verify billing account administrator access
- For Azure, confirm billing profile contributor permissions

**Missing tag values**: 
- Verify that resource labels are applied to the correct compute environment
- Check that workflows are using the tagged compute environment
- For dynamic labels, ensure variables use correct syntax: `${workflowId}` and `${sessionId}`
