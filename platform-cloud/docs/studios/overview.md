Studios is a unified platform where you can host a combination of container images and compute environments for interactive analysis using your preferred tools, like JupyterLab notebooks, an [R-IDE](https://github.com/seqeralabs/r-ide), Visual Studio Code IDEs, or Xpra remote desktops. Each Studio session is an individual interactive environment that encapsulates the live environment for dynamic data analysis.

On Seqera Cloud, the free tier permits only one running Studio session at a time. To run simultaneous sessions, [contact Seqera][contact] for a Seqera Cloud Pro license.

:::note
Studios supports [AWS Cloud][aws-cloud], [AWS Batch][aws-batch] (without Fargate enabled), [Azure Cloud][azure-cloud], and [Google Cloud][google-cloud] compute environments.
