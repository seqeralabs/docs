Organizations are the top-level structure and contain workspaces, members, and teams. Before you start using Platform, consider the projects, research areas, and resources you'd like to build out and who'll be using them so that you can scale up easily. 

You can create multiple organizations, each of which can contain multiple workspaces with shared users and resources. This means you can customize and organize the use of resources while maintaining an access control layer for users associated with a workspace. A workspace can be public (shared across the organization) or private (accessible only to the user who created it)

Within an organization, you have members - users that you add to your organization who will access and use Platform - and they're organized into teams. Teams provide a way to group members such as `workflow-developers` or `analysts`, and apply access control for all users within that team.

Lastly, you can also add external users (collaborators) to shared workspaces within your organization.

:::note
Organizations consist of members, while workspaces consist of participants.

### Create an organization

When you create an organization, you become the organization owner. Organization owners can add or remove members from an organization or workspace, and can allocate specific access roles within workspaces. You can also add external collaborators to an organization.

1. From the user menu, select [Your organizations](https://cloud.seqera.io/orgs), then **Add Organization**.
2. Enter a **Name** and **Full name** for your organization.
3. Enter any other optional fields as needed: **Description**, **Location**, **Website URL**, and **Logo**.
4. Select **Add**.

You can invite or add additional members to the workspace from the workspace **Settings** page. 

### Organization settings 

Organization owners can view, edit, and delete organizations in the **Organization settings** screen. Select your organization from the drop-down menu, then select **Settings** in the sidebar.

#### Edit or delete an organization 

Select **Edit** in the **Edit organization** row to update the organization name, full name, description, location, website URL, and logo. Select **Update** to save.

To delete your organization, select **Delete** in the **Delete organization** card. 

## Members

You can view the list of all **Members** from the organization's landing page. 

Seqera provides access control for members of an organization by classifying them either as an **Owner** or a **Member**. Each organization can have multiple owners and members.

### Add a member

To add a new member to an organization:

1. Go to the **Members** tab in the sidebar of the organization landing page.
2. Select **Add member**.
3. Enter the name or email address of the user you'd like to add to the organization.

An email invitation will be sent to the user. Once they accept the invitation, they can switch to the organization (or organization workspace) from the workspace dropdown.

:::note
For information about what happens when a user deletes their account, see [user deletion](../data-privacy/overview#user-deletion).
:::

## Teams

**Teams** allow organization **owners** to group members and collaborators together into a single unit and to manage them as a whole.

### Create a new team

To create a new team:

1. Go to the **Teams** tab in the sidebar of the organization landing page.
2. Select **Add Team**.
3. Enter the **Name** of team.
4. Optionally, add the **Description** and the team's **Avatar**.
5. Select **Add**.

To start adding members to your team, select **Edit > Members of team > Add member** and enter the name or email address of the organization members or collaborators.

## Collaborators

**Collaborators** are users who are invited to an organization's workspace, but are not members of that organization. As a result, their access is limited to that organization's workspace. You can view the list of all organization **Collaborators** from the organization's landing page.

New collaborators to an organization's workspace can be added as **Participants** from the workspace page. See [User roles](./roles) to learn more about participant access levels.

:::note
**Collaborators** can only be added from a workspace. For more information, see [workspace management](./workspace-management#create-a-new-workspace).

## Organization resource usage tracking 

Select **Usage overview** next to the organization and workspace selector dropdown to view a window with the following usage details:

- **Run history**: The total number of pipeline runs. 
- **Concurrent runs**: Total simultaneous pipeline runs.
- **Running Studio sessions**: Number of concurrent running Studio sessions.
- **Users**: Total users per organization. 

Organization resource usage information is also displayed on the organization's **Settings** tab in the sidebar of the organization landing page. 

Select **Contact us to upgrade** if you need to increase your Platform usage limits for your organization. 

:::info
Usage limits differ per organization and [subscription type](https://seqera.io/pricing/). [Contact us](https://seqera.io/contact-us/) to discuss your needs. 
:::

### Credits 

[Seqera Compute](../compute-envs/seqera-compute) environments consume credits when running pipelines or Studio sessions. Credits are consumed for CPU time, memory and storage usage, and network costs. One Seqera Compute credit is equivalent to $1 (USD), and resources are charged at the following rates:

- CPU time: 1 CPU/Hr = 0.1 credits
- Memory: 1 GiB/Hr = 0.025 credits 
- Storage: 1 GB = 0.025 credits per month 

:::note 
Storage and network costs vary per region and are charged at standard AWS rates. Data ingress and egress across regions incur additional costs. 
:::

Your available credit balance depends on the credits purchased and limits applied to your Seqera license. The **Credits** view contains the current credit balance available to the organization, and the total credits spent in the organization's workspaces. Select **Contact us to upgrade** to request additional credits for your organization.
