Organization owners can assign role-based access levels to individual **participants** and **teams** in an organization workspace.

:::tip
You can group **members** and **collaborators** into **teams** and apply a role to that team. Members and collaborators inherit the access role of the team.
:::

### Organization user roles

- **Owner**: After an organization is created, the user who created the organization is the default owner of that organization. Additional users can be assigned as organization owners. Owners have full read/write access to modify members, teams, collaborators, and settings within an organization.
- **Member**: A member is a user who is internal to the organization. Members have an organization role and can operate in one or more organization workspaces. In each workspace, members have a participant role that defines the permissions granted to them within that workspace.

### Role inheritance

If a user is concurrently assigned to a workspace as both a named **participant** and member of a **team**, Seqera assigns the higher of the two privilege sets.

Example:

- If the participant role is Launch and the team role is Admin, the user will have Admin rights.
- If the participant role is Admin and the team role is Launch, the user will have Admin rights.
- If the participant role is Launch and the team role is Launch, the user will have Launch rights.

As a best practice, use teams as the primary vehicle for assigning rights within a workspace and only add named participants when one-off privilege escalations are necessary.

### Workspace participant roles

:::note
Workspace participants with any role can leave the workspace, i.e., remove themselves as a workspace participant. However, only workspace owners and admins can add or remove workspace participants other than themselves.
