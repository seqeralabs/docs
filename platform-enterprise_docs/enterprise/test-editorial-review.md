This document contains intentional editorial issues to test the automated review workflow.

## Overview

Tower is a platform that allows the user to run pipelines. The platform will be used by administrators to configure compute envs for running workflows. This is a really, really long sentence that goes on and on and should probably be split up because it's way over thirty words long and that makes it harder for users to read and comprehend the information being conveyed.

## Getting Started

First, you should navigate to the Settings menu. Click on the dropdown and select Credentials. The credentials will be displayed to the user in a table format.

To create a compute environment:

1. Click Add Compute Environment
2. Fill in the required fields
3. Click Save

## Configuration

The configuration file should be placed in your home directory. The user must ensure that all values are set correctly, otherwise the pipeline might fail.

Use nextflow run to execute the pipeline. The --profile parameter can be specified to select different configuration profiles.

## Advanced Topics

Multi-QC reports can be generated automatically. NextFlow handles the orchestration of tasks efficiently.

When using the platform, you should consider the following best practices:
- Configure your CE properly
- Set up creds for cloud providers
- Enable Data Explorer for visualization

The system is designed to be flexible and it will allow for customization of various parameters as needed by the organization.
