## Critical bug fixes

**GCS compose conflicts**

- Fixed concurrent compose operation conflicts in Google Cloud Storage.
- When multiple Fusion instances compose the same target file concurrently (e.g., with Nextflow job arrays where all array jobs overwrite `.exitcode`), temporary objects created during composition could conflict.
- Prevents conflicts when concurrent instances attempt to create, use, or delete the same temporary files.

## Upgrade notes

Drop-in replacement for v2.5.x. No configuration changes required.
