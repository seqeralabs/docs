Fusion 2.5.0 significantly enhances performance and efficiency in file operations. 

Fusion now handles small files more effectively and intelligently manages Nextflow task files by minimizing intermediate file uploads. A key improvement is the selective retention of only essential task output files upon completion, reducing storage overhead. Network optimization has been implemented to decrease bandwidth usage by consolidating upload operations. Additionally, the underlying architecture has undergone substantial refactoring to support the future integration of diverse remote storage solutions, setting the foundation for expanded storage capabilities.

### Feature updates and improvements

- Chunked async content management
- Nextflow-compatible pattern classifier
- Define a default exit code on Fusion-IO errors
- Object API refactoring
- Bump golang.org/x/crypto to 0.31.0
- Bump golang.org/x/net to 0.33.0

### Bug fixes 

- AsyncStore move issues
- Log file deletion during spot instance reclamation 
- Transient object persistence
