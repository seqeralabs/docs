## Description
The latest release significantly enhances performance and efficiency in file operations. The system now handles small files more effectively and intelligently manages Nextflow task files by minimizing intermediate file uploads. A key improvement is the selective retention of only essential task output files upon completion, reducing storage overhead. Network optimization has been implemented to decrease bandwidth usage by consolidating upload operations. Additionally, the underlying architecture has undergone substantial refactoring to support the future integration of diverse remote storage solutions, setting the foundation for expanded storage capabilities.
