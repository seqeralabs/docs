## Feature updates and improvements

### Logging

- **Better log readability**: Added `[seqera-fusion]` prefix to console logs for easier identification in mixed output environments.
- **Improved error messages**: Added more context and clearer wording to cloud provider errors, including better messages for archived/cold storage objects.

## Bug fixes

### AWS

- **Fixed misleading "file not found" errors**: Changed permission errors (403 Forbidden) from cloud providers to display as "Permission denied" instead of incorrectly showing "No such file or directory" (#1068).

### General

- **Cloud errors now log properly**: Fixed an issue where cloud service errors were silently treated as simple "file not found" cases instead of logging and reporting properly (#1077).

## Upgrade notes

Drop-in replacement for v2.4.x. No configuration changes required.
