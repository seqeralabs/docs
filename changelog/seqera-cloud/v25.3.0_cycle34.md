## Feature updates and improvements

### Studios

- Added the ability to configure a custom container repository path for Wave-built Studio images in workspace settings, providing greater control over where container images are stored and distributed.

## Bug fixes

### General

- Addressed a security vulnerability related to resource allocation, improving overall Platform security.

### Resource labels

- Fixed an issue with interpolated values in dynamic resource labels (e.g., `label-name=${workflowId}`). Dynamic resource labels now work correctly when enabling the feature for all workspaces.

### Workflows

- Fixed an issue with deleted workflows incorrectly counted toward organization quota limits. Active workflow counts now accurately exclude deleted workflows.
