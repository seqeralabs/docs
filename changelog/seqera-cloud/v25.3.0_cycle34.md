## General updates and improvements

- **Studios**
  - Added the ability to configure a custom container repository path for Wave-built Studio images in workspace settings, providing greater control over where container images are stored and distributed.

## Bug fixes

- Addressed a security vulnerability related to resource allocation, improving overall Platform security.
- Fixed an issue where dynamic resource labels with interpolated values (e.g., `label-name=${workflowId}`) were rejected. Dynamic resource labels now work correctly when the feature is enabled for all workspaces.
- Fixed an issue with deleted workflows being incorrectly counted toward organization quota limits. Active workflow counts now accurately exclude deleted workflows.
