### New features and improvements

## Seqera Compute

[Seqera Compute](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/seqera-compute) is now in public preview. Seqera Compute is a fully managed, optimized compute environment which eliminates infrastructure complexity by automating environment setup, resource provisioning, scaling, and optimization. [Manage your resources and costs effectively with Seqera Compute credits](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/seqera-compute#manage-seqera-compute-credits), launch .

## Platform interface updates

### Pipeline run details

The [pipelines run details](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/monitoring/run-details#tasks) view has been refreshed and includes improvements such as:

- Clear, dynamic view of pipeline execution in real time via a progress bar.
- A dedicated **Run info** tab with a centralized view of run metadata and status details.
- Improved navigation tabs for **Tasks**, **Logs**, **Metrics**, and **Containers**.

### New Seqera Platform sidebar

The Platform top navigation has been replaced with a sidebar for improved navigation. 

## AWS Cloud compute environment

The [new AWS Cloud compute environment](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/compute-envs/aws-cloud) supports faster startup time, simplified configuration, and fewer AWS dependencies, as well as allowing Studios to launch on Spot instances. This type of compute environment is best suited to run Studios and small to medium-sized pipelines. It offers more predictable compute pricing, given the fixed instance type. It spins up a standalone EC2 instance and executes a Nextflow pipeline or Studio session with a local executor on the EC2 machine. At the end of the execution, the instance is terminated.

## General improvements

- **Fusion**
  - Add Fusion snapshots to AWS Batch.
  - Enable `DRAINING` status for Spot instance reclamation. When an Instance status is DRAINING, no new task can be scheduled on it. More info on this behaviour can be found at [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/spot-instance-draining-linux-container.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/spot-instance-draining-linux-container.html).
  - AWS Cloud compute environment defaults to the public Seqera AMI if no AMI ID is specified during compute environment creation.
- **Studios**
  - Add Spot option for AWS single VM compute environment.
- Support markdown rendering for Nextflow object field `help_text` and `description` properties.
