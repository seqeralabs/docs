## Feature updates and improvements

- **Datasets**
  - Added support for date-only formats in search queries, allowing you to search using simple dates (e.g., 2025-02-02) instead of full ISO-8601 datetime strings.
- Added pipeline version numbers and descriptions to preconfigured onboarding pipelines, making it easier to understand what each pipeline does.

## Bug fixes

- **Data Explorer**
  - Fixed an issue where filtering for Azure credentials in Data Explorer only returned one credential type instead of all three available Azure credential types.
  - Fixed an issue where the Data Explorer link would not appear in Task View when multiple AWS credentials with similar permissions were configured in the workspace.
- Fixed an issue where Seqera Compute environments did not apply proper EC2 instance type constraints, ensuring consistent compute environment behavior and preventing instance unavailability issues.
- Fixed an issue where users could dismiss critical notifications about compute environment substitutions when relaunching pipelines, ensuring important status messages remain visible throughout the workflow.
