## General updates and improvements

- **Studios**
  - Improved Studio creation responsiveness by preparing Docker build context files asynchronously, allowing scripts and configuration files to be included without blocking the initial request.
- **Data Explorer**
  - Added support for LakeFS Cloud in Data Explorer by enabling image preview and file upload functionality when using LakeFS Cloud as an S3-compatible storage provider.
- Improved job failure handling in AWS Batch compute environments. Improved AWS Batch workflow behavior to automatically terminate unschedulable jobs instead of leaving them pending indefinitely, providing faster feedback when compute resources are insufficient for workflow requirements.
- Added the g6e instance family to the list of AWS instances with NVMe storage.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where YAML validation errors were not displayed immediately when importing Studio configurations from Git repositories, ensuring configuration issues are now visible as soon as the import completes.
- Fixed an issue where AWS single VM compute environments could not pull container images from private Amazon ECR repositories, bringing them to feature parity with AWS Batch compute environments.
- Fixed an issue with older pipeline launch records, where the source type had no been set properly resulting in failure to access the Pipeline entity on launch.
