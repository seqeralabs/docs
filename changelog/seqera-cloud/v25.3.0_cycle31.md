## General updates and improvements

- **Studios**
  - Improved Studio creation responsiveness by preparing Docker build context files asynchronously, allowing scripts and configuration files to be included without blocking the initial request.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where YAML validation errors were not displayed immediately when importing Studio configurations from Git repositories, ensuring configuration issues are now visible as soon as the import completes.
