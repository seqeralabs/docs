### General updates and improvements

- **Studios**
    - Added an environment variable that supports launching Studios with an iframe served by Connect. To enable this, use the `TOWER_DATA_STUDIO_ENABLE_CONNECT_IFRAME` environment variable. 
- Added the NVMe-enabled `g6f` AWS instance type. See the AWS announcement here: [https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/07/amazon-ec2-g6f-instances-fractional-gpus/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/07/amazon-ec2-g6f-instances-fractional-gpus/)
- Added support for BitBucket API tokens to ensure that Bitbucket can still be used as an API provider. See the announcement for more information: [https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/).
