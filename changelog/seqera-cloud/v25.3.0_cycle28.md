### General updates and improvements

- **Seqera Compute**
  - Updated documentation on free credit entitlement and management.
- **Platform**
  - Added a copy button to data display chips, allowing you to quickly copy displayed values to your clipboard.
  - Added an improved onboarding flow for Seqera Compute customers to quickly run pipelines.
- **Pipelines**
  - Added support for [pinning](https://docs.seqera.io/pipelines/overview#pin-commit-id) the HEAD commit ID of the chosen revision to guarantee deterministic pipeline execution.
- **Data Explorer**
  - Added support for image preview and file upload in Data Explorer when using Amazon S3-compatible API storage (for example, but not limited to, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, and Oracle Cloud).
- Added the ability to read task logs on Azure Cloud from Azure Blob Storage after pipeline completion, ensuring logs remain accessible throughout the entire task lifecycle.
- Updated the nf-launcher container versions from 25.04.6 to 25.04.8 for both standard and Docker-in-Docker variants.
- Updated the default Seqera AMI version to 0.0.10 for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures in AWS Cloud deployments.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where resuming pipelines failed due to incorrect identification of launchable entity types.
- Fixed issues where version name autogeneration used incorrect defaults and navigation returned users to the wrong page when editing pipeline versions.
- Fixed an issue where users with **Launch** permissions could not access Studios due to insufficient workspace settings permissions.
- Fixed an issue where administrators could accidentally create duplicate user accounts due to differences in email address casing.
