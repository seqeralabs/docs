### UI/UX

- Implemented `FaviconService` that changes the favicon based on pipeline run or Studio status.

### General

- Increase `accessTokenExpirationTime` by 10% to always trigger a token refresh when Platform is open in a browser tab that isn't hibernated.

## Bug fixes

### API

- Fixed an additional reference to the `mainScript` parameter in the `pipeline-info` API response.
