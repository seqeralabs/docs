### Feature updates and improvements

- **Studios**
  - Add Studio session lifespan setting. This feature allows you to set a lifespan for a session, after which the session is stopped automatically. 
  - Add Studios resource labels support. Workspace admins and owners can edit resource labels inherited from the compute environment and apply them to a Studio session. The edited resource labels associated with each session donâ€™t affect the default resource labels associated with the compute environment.
- **Free tier**
  - Reduce the maximum number of organization members to 3.
  - Resource tracking in the Platform UI for improved management of free tier limits.
  - User disable/re-enable is now supported.
- **Fusion**
  - AWS Batch compute environments default to Amazon Linux 2023 AMI when Fusion v2 is enabled
- Implement collapsible view for JSON workflow parameters tab and add **View as YAML** option.
- Notify the user when secrets cleanup fails.
- Update the pipeline name regular expression to allow pipeline names containing dots ('.').
- Mark long-running jobs with a warning: This warning will be displayed when a workflow has been in the `RUNNING` state for more than 3 hours and no single task moved from one state to the next.
- Set `ECS_CONTAINER_START_TIMEOUT` to 10 minutes in the ECS settings used by AWS Batch CEs in order to prevent the error `Task failed to start - DockerTimeoutError: Could not transition to started; timed out after waiting 3m0s`.
- Upgrade to Angular 18

### Bug fixes

- **Studios**
  - Fixed an issue with searches for names containing special SQL wildcard characters (_, %).
  - Fixed an issue to ensure that the **Maintain** role is not able to change resource labels inherited from the selected compute environment when adding/starting a Studio.
