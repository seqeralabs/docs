## Bug fixes

### Launchpad

- Fixed an empty launch form issue when launching shared pipelines from another workspace. The launch form now correctly retrieves and displays all pipeline configuration when launching shared pipelines across workspaces.

### General

- Fixed OIDC authentication errors with spaces or special characters that caused application crashes instead of displaying proper error messages. Authentication errors during login now display correctly to users, preventing application failures.
