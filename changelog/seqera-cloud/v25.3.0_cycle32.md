## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where launching shared pipelines from another workspace would fail to load pipeline configuration data, resulting in an empty launch form. The launch form now correctly retrieves and displays all pipeline configuration when launching shared pipelines across workspaces.
- Fixed an issue where OIDC authentication errors containing spaces or special characters caused application crashes instead of displaying proper error messages. Authentication errors during login now display correctly to users, preventing application failures.
