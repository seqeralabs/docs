## Feature updates and improvements

- **Fusion**
  - Added FSx Lustre support for Amazon Linux 2023 AMIs with automatic fallback from the Amazon Linux 2 installation method.
- **Platform API**
  - Added an optional `maxLength` query parameter to workflow log endpoints (`GET /{workflowId}/log` and `GET /{workflowId}/log/{taskId}`) for improved log management.
  - Added the [managed identity and managed credentials endpoint](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-api/info/identities-info) to Seqera Platform API documentation.
- Improved warning messages in Seqera Platform when workflows are cancelled or Studios are stopped due to insufficient credits.
- Removed the role check to show organization member mail, so organization owners can now view member and collaborator emails.
- Added user tracking fields to datasets and dataset versions. Datasets now include a `lastUpdatedBy` field to track the user who last modified the dataset, while dataset versions include a `createdBy` field to track the user who created each version.
- Improved the visual consistency and user experience across workflow run interfaces. Updates include improved table borders, enhanced tooltip information, and refined pagination layouts in the containers view.
