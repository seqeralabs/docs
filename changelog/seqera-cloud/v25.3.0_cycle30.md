## General updates and improvements

- Improved label inheritance when launching workflows via API to automatically apply predefined labels when the labelIds field is omitted, aligning API functionality with the GUI and simplifying workflow relaunches.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the settings button in the usage overview widget incorrectly displayed workspace permissions in organization context, and improved workspace settings visibility to dynamically show or hide based on user permissions.
- Fixed an issue where creator avatars were not displaying in the pipeline version details view due to a missing avatar URL conversion.
- Fixed an issue where workspace settings buttons displayed incorrectly based on user permissions and context, ensuring the settings button now shows the appropriate organization or workspace settings based on the current view.
