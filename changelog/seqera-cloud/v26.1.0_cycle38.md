## Feature updates and improvements

### Studios

- Added SSH connectivity toggle to Studio forms, allowing users to enable or disable SSH access when creating or starting Studios.
- Added feature detection for one-time token support in Studios to determine whether to send deprecated long-lived tokens to the client.
- Extended the Remaining Credits Estimation system to track Studio sessions for credit consumption prediction, even when no workflows are running.

### Compute environments

- Fixed compute environment listing failures for legacy Seqera Compute Batch configurations that don't implement `IAwsCloudConfig`.
- Fixed compute environment listing when requesting attributes for deprecated platforms.
- Fixed validation to enforce the default `m5d.large` instance type for Seqera Compute environments.

### Pipelines

- Implemented transparent hash version upgrade mechanism that automatically detects and upgrades outdated pipeline version hashes during comparison operations without persisting changes.
- Implemented `VersionedHash` class to provide structured, type-safe access to version hash strings throughout the platform, improving code maintainability and enabling future hash algorithm upgrades.
- Removed the `pipeline_version_created` audit event in favor of the existing `pipeline_updated` event, which already tracks pipeline version creation.

### Permissions and roles

- Added tristate checkboxes to category rows in the custom roles permissions table, allowing users to quickly select or deselect all permissions within a category.
- Consolidated Members, Teams, and Collaborators pages into the Access Control page as tabs with pagination support for Teams list and empty-state components.
- Added admin endpoint `GET /api/admin/orgs/{orgId}/roles` to list organization roles.
- Added endpoint `GET /orgs/{orgId}/users/{userId}/roles` to list user roles in organization.
- Added `maxCustomRolesPerOrg` quota definition and enforcement, limiting the number of custom roles per organization.

### Data Explorer

- Fixed file preview functionality for files containing special characters (brackets) in filenames by properly encoding and decoding file paths.

### General

- Updated container `max-width` from 1120px to 1672px for improved layout readability on data-dense pages.
- Improved error messaging when attempting to delete labels that cannot be removed.
- Updated DRAGEN compute environment helper text to recommend f2 instances instead of deprecated f1 instances.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed **Open in new tab** functionality for workflow reports by implementing a separate route with report path passed as query parameter.
- Fixed step status indication mechanism in launch forms to properly track all controls registered to a section, including those registered after initial creation.
- Fixed Data Explorer path decoding to be null-safe, preventing test failures.
- Fixed an issue causing custom pipeline info fetch error messages to be incorrectly removed when selecting the same value again in pipeline, revision, or main script fields.
- Fixed an issue causing empty optimization buttons to be displayed on the Launchpad when optimization status is not set.
- Prevent conda Studios from auto-starting when the organization exceeds Studio session limits.
- Temporarily disabled Data Explorer integration test that relies on Google Cloud public bucket after access to the bucket changed.
