### Feature updates and improvements

- **Studios**
  - Private sessions: When adding a new session, the number of concurrent connections can now be defined in **General Config > Collaboration**.
  - Dynamic Studio templates: Labels have been added to indicate the status of support (e.g., *Recommended*, *Deprecated*) for a Studio template version. Users can now also switch the Studio's base template image when starting a session as new.
- **Nextflow**
  - Update `WfManifest` class to include the new `icon` property introduced in Nextflow.
  - Add a new migration file to add the new icon column into all the tables of entities that use the `WfManifest` class as @Embedded property.
- Audit log update: Pipeline edit events are now logged.
- Added `totalProcesses` count to workflow progress responses.
- Switch AWS Batch compute environment dependencies to AWS SDK v2.
- New workflow job monitoring collects and publishes Platform metrics.
- Support image upload in the pipeline import and pipeline update forms, to be used as pipeline logos.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where resource labels were erroneously editable for the maintain role when starting an existing Studio.
- Fixed a potential `NullPointerException` on code related to Google Batch, where the method is expected to return `null`.
- Fixed an issue where users were not able to remove the organization logo.
