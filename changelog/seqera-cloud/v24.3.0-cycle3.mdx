- Studios:
    - Display the applied date filter on the Dashboard page.
    - Add support for custom templates for input control options such as workspace visibility and session lifespan.
- Fusion:
    - Default to Amazon Linux 2023 AMI when Fusion v2 is enabled.
    - Add support for Fusion licensing.
- (Enterprise only) Add a job to save usage metrics to files so usage data can be accessed and shared by users even when theyâ€™re not connected to License Manager.
- Implement `FaviconService` that changes the favicon based on pipeline run or Studio status.
- Increase `accessTokenExpirationTime` by 10% to always trigger a token refresh when Platform is open in a browser tab that isn't hibernated.
