### General updates and improvements

  - Added the ability to filter pipeline runs by dataset ID using the datasetId: search keyword, improving traceability between datasets and workflows.
- **Pipelines**
  - Added [pipeline versioning](https://docs.seqera.io/pipelines/overview#pipeline-versioning) for enhanced pipeline configuration management and traceability. 
  - Added support for [pinning](https://docs.seqera.io/pipelines/overview#pin-commit-id) the HEAD commit ID of the chosen revision to guarantee deterministic pipeline execution.
  - Added support for version-specific pipeline schema retrieval through an optional `versionId` query parameter on the `/pipelines/{pipelineId}/` schema and `/pipelines/{pipelineId}/launch` endpoints.
  - Enhanced the pipeline details page with an improved layout when pipeline versioning is enabled, providing better organization of pipeline information.

### Bug fixes
