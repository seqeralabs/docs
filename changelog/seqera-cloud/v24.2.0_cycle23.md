## Bug fixes

### Data Explorer

- Added routing to enable task working directory navigation using Data Explorer in personal workspaces.

### Compute environments

- Hidden compute environment variables section actions when disabling the component (previously indicated that environment variables could be edited in this state).

### General

- Removed **-/+** increment buttons from numeric input components in Platform, including compute environment and launch form interfaces.
