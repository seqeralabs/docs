### Breaking changes

- Restore `errorStrategy` and `maxRetries` default Nextflow config for AWS and GCP launches. Platform will not overwrite existing error strategy coded in the pipeline repository.
- If you want to automatically retry on task failures (e.g., from spot reclamations), you will now need to explicitly set `errorStrategy` and `maxRetries`.
- Automatic spot retries in AWS and GCP need to be actively enabled. Alternatively the generic failure is handled at the Nextflow level.

**You can revert to the default setting used in Nextflow prior to 24.10 with the following configuration options:**
```
aws.batch.maxSpotAttempts = 5
google.batch.maxSpotAttempts = 5
```
Set `task.maxRetries` to a non-zero value to restore Platform to prior behaviour.

**How do I retry Spot failures while making them visible?**

There is no mechanism in Nextflow to specifically report Spot retries. However you can set `process.maxRetries = 5` to retry all failures (including Spot reclamations) a specified number of times before failure.

### Feature updates and improvements

- Data Studios:
    - Added data studio API endpoints to the OpenAPI spec.
- New dynamic page title for easy bookmarking.
- Free tier:
    - New organization types added to allow free tier users to monitor their usage and limits.
- Restore `errorStrategy` default Nextflow config for AWS and GCP launches. The Nextflow job now correctly terminates after pipeline completion.
- Improved error messaging when pipeline info can't be fetched indicates whether the issue is due to a missing resource, or failed authentication due to expired credentials.
- Azure jobs are now automatically terminated after all tasks are complete.
- Send only added/updated run parameters when launching a pipeline. This includes all defaults and parameters passed during the launch.
- Updated list of EC2 families with NVMe disks available.
- Upgrade to Angular 17
- Bump Nextflow launcher to 24.10.3

### Bug fixes 

- Allow unsetting `schemaName` when editing a pipeline.
- Use `preferred_username` as fallback email field for OIDC login.
- Drop the last characters in job definition name, if longer than the prescribed limit.
- Compute environment creation form allows pre- and post-run scripts to be longer than the accepted value of 1024 characters.
- Prohibit duplicate Git credentials and tie-break on `lastUpdated` for existing duplicates. Going forward, preference is given to the credentials updated last in the situation when there are multiple candidates. Additionally a duplicate check is added when creating new credentials, to avoid new duplicate cases.
- Disable reset selection on data change in workflow list component.
- Take into account the alternative `mainScript` path.
