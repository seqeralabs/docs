## General updates and improvements

### Studios

  - Added validation to ensure the workspace container repository setting is configured before allowing custom-built Studios to be created.
  - Added Studios to the onboarding resources shown to new users during account setup, helping users discover Studio functionality early in their journey.
  - Removed the ability to start and stop Studios from the **Launch** role to better align permissions with user responsibilities.

### Compute

  - Added Amazon EC2 p6-b300 instance family to the NVMe storage list, enabling support for this new GPU-optimized instance type.
  - Added SingleVM support for Seqera Compute environments, enabling workflows to run on dedicated VMs instead of job queuing systems.
  - Implemented the ability to disable and enable compute environments through the UI, allowing administrators to temporarily prevent workflow execution on specific environments.
  - Improved error messaging when attempting to launch workflows on disabled compute environments. The error message now explicitly states **Specified compute environment has been disabled** instead of the generic **Not available** message.
  - Added Amazon EC2 X8aedz memory-optimized instance family (powered by AMD EPYC processors) to the NVMe storage list, supporting up to 8 TB of local NVMe SSD storage.
  - Updated the default Azure Batch image and improved error propagation for image-related failures.

### Workflows

 - Added tracking for Spot instance interruptions (`numSpotInterruptions`) at the task level, aggregated to the workflow level. This metric tracks how many times tasks were interrupted and restarted due to Spot instance preemption.

### Launchpad

 - Renamed the **Config view** button to **Params file view** in the launch form parameter section for better clarity and consistency with terminology.

## Bug fixes

### Studios

- Fixed an issue where basic organizations could run more than one Studio simultaneously. Basic organizations now default to a maximum of 1 running Studio when no explicit quota is set, while other organization types use the global limit (default: 100).

### Compute

- Fixed intermittent workflow launch failures caused by expired AWS STS credentials being returned from cache. Added expiration checking, configurable refresh margin, and cache invalidation for expired entries.
- Reverted Azure Batch to use Ubuntu 22.04 (from 24.04) because Fusion doesn't work out of the box with Ubuntu 24.04.
- Fixed errors when listing compute environments with the `resources` attribute for legacy Seqera Compute Batch configurations that don't implement `IAwsCloudConfig`. Added proper handling and fallback logic.

### Pipeline versioning

- Fixed an issue where the pipeline versions list was not correctly updated when a draft version was published.

### Launchpad

- Fixed an issue where parameters were not properly cleared when switching between pipelines with and without parameters in the launch form.
- Fixed date formatting to use calendar year (`yyyy`) instead of ISO week-based year (`YYYY`), which was causing dates at year boundaries to display the wrong year.
- Fixed the merging of entity and compute environment labels for single VM compute environments to ensure labels are properly combined and applied.
