## Feature updates and improvements

### Permissions and roles

- Improved error messages for insufficient permissions. API 403 Forbidden responses now include details about which specific permissions are missing, making it easier to troubleshoot authorization issues and grant appropriate access.

### Compute environments

- New AWS Batch compute environments can no longer be created with the deprecated EBS autoscaling feature enabled; use Fusion as the recommended alternative instead. Existing compute environments with EBS autoscaling will continue to work without changes.

## Bug fixes

### Pipelines

- Fixed an issue with pipeline optimization being unavailable for shared pipelines in personal workspaces.
- Fixed an issue with pipeline optimization permission controls. Users with Launch permissions can now view optimization status and details in read-only mode, while users with Maintain or higher permissions can modify optimization settings.
