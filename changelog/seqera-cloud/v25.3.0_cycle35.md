## General updates and improvements

- **Studios**
  - Added the ability to configure a custom container repository path for Wave-built Studio images in workspace settings, providing greater control over where container images are stored and distributed.
- Improved error messages for insufficient permissions. API 403 Forbidden responses now include details about which specific permissions are missing, making it easier to troubleshoot authorization issues and grant appropriate access.
- New AWS Batch compute environments can no longer be created with the deprecated EBS autoscale feature enabled; use Fusion as the recommended alternative instead. Existing compute environments with EBS autoscale continue to function without changes.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the optimization button was hidden for shared pipelines in personal workspaces and tooltip messages did not accurately reflect why optimization was unavailable.
- Fixed an issue with pipeline optimization permission controls. Users with Launch permissions can now view optimization status and details in read-only mode, while only users with Maintain or higher permissions can modify optimization settings.
