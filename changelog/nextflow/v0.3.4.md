- Extending semantic for method File.copyTo(source,target) so that when 'target' argument
  is a directory, it copies the 'source' file to that folder, with the same name as the original file.
- Bug: Fixed a ClassCastEx exception when the 'bin' folder is added to the PATH
- Bug: Fixed an issue that raised an error "error=26 Text file busy" on some platforms (CentOS)
