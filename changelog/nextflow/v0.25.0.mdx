### Special note

* Directive `maxErrors` new default is `-1`, this means that by default this value is ignored when a task execution is retried and only maxRetries value the is taken in consideration.
* Docker input mounts are now enforced as read-only. This has been done to mitigate possible security concerns when using Docker containers. It must noted that this is coherent with the idempotent nature of nextflow processes by which a task cannot have side-effects (and therefore modify the input files).
* SGE, PBS/Torque  and NGSII executors do not specify any more the `-V` flag when submitting a job request. If you need to export the user environment in your task you will need to add it by using the `clusterOptions` directive.
