Latest release of MultiQC with some tasty new functions..
- New `multiqc_sources.txt` which identifies the paths used to collect all report data for each sample
- Export parsed data as tab-delimited text, `JSON` or `YAML` using the new `-k`/`--data-format` command line option
- Updated HighCharts from `v4.2.2` to `v4.2.3`, fixes tooltip hover bug.
- Nicer export button. Now tied to the export toolbox, hopefully more intuitive.
- FastQC: Per base sequence content heatmap can now be clicked to show line graph for single sample
- FastQC: No longer show adapter contamination datasets with &lte; 0.1% contamination.
- Picard: Added support for `CollectOxoGMetrics` reports.
- Changed command line option `--name` to `--filename`
- `--name` also used for filename if `--filename` not specified.
- Hide samples toolbox now has switch to _show only_ matching samples
- New regex help box with examples added to report
- New button to copy general stats table to the clipboard
- General Stats table 'floating' header now sorts properly when scrolling
- Bugfix: MultiQC default_dev template now copies module assets properly
