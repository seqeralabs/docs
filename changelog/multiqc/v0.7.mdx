## Version 0.7 of MultiQC!

This is quite a big release: 141 commits since v0.6, with 4,587 new lines of code and 2,116 lines deleted (or updated), affecting 75 files. Many thanks to everyone for your patience.

### MultiQC is published!

If you didn't hear about it - the reason that I wanted to keep the main release stable was because the MultiQC paper was under review. It went well, and MultiQC is now published! You can see it here:

> **MultiQC: Summarize analysis results for multiple tools and samples in a single report**
> _Philip Ewels, Måns Magnusson, Sverker Lundin and Max Käller_
> Bioinformatics (2016)
> doi: [10.1093/bioinformatics/btw354](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw354)
> PMID: [27312411](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27312411)

Many thanks to everyone involved.

### Module updates:

Not a huge number of new modules this time, but lots of fixed bugs and quite a few big extensions / refactoring of big modules.
- [**Kallisto**](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) - new module!
- **Picard**
  - Code refactored to make maintenance and additions easier.
  - Big update to `HsMetrics` parsing - more results shown in report, new plots (by @lpantano)
  - Updated `InsertSizeMetrics` to understand logs generated by `CollectMultipleMetrics` (#215)
  - Newlines in picard output. Fixed by @dakl
- **Samtools**
  - Code refactored
  - Rewrote the `samtools stats` code to display more stats in report with a beeswarm plot.
- **Qualimap**
  - Rewritten to use latest methods and fix bugs.
  - Added _Percentage Aligned_ column to general stats for `BamQC` module.
  - Extra table thresholds added by @avilella (hidden by default)
- **General Statistics**
  - Some tweaks to the display defaults (FastQC, Bismark, Qualimap, SnpEff)
  - Now possible to skip the General Statistics section of the report with `--exclude general_stats`
- **Cutadapt** module updated to recognise logs from old versions of cutadapt (<= v1.6)
- **Trimmomatic**
  - Now handles `,` decimal places in percentage values.
  - Can cope with line breaks in log files (see issue #212)
- **FastQC** refactored
  - Now skips zip files if the sample name has already been found. Speeds up MultiQC execution.
  - Code cleaned up. Parsing and data-structures standardised.
  - New popovers on Pass / Warn / Fail status bars showing sample names. Fast highlighting and hiding.
  - New column in General Stats (hidden by default) showing percentage of FastQC modules that failed.
- **SnpEff**
  - Search pattern now more generic, should match reports from others.
  - _Counts by Effect_ plot removed (had hundreds of categories, was fairly unusable).
  - `KeyError` bug fixed.
- **Samblaster** now gets sample name from `ID` instead of `SM` (@dakl)
- **Bowtie 2**
  - Now parses overall alignment rate as intended.
  - Now depends on even less log contents to work with more inputs.
- **MethylQA** now handles variable spacing in logs
- **featureCounts** now splits columns on tabs instead of whitespace, can handle filenames with spaces

### Core updates:
- **Galaxy**: MultiQC now available in Galaxy! Work by @devengineson / @yvanlebras / @cmonjeau

- Can now **cancel execution** with a single `ctrl+c` rather than having to button mash
