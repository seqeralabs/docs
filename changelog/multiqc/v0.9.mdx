A major new feature is released in v0.9 - support for _custom content_. This means that MultiQC can now easily include output from custom scripts within reports without the need for a new module or plugin. For more information, please see the [MultiQC documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#custom-content).

Module updates:
- [**HTSeq**](http://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq/doc/count.html) - new module!
  - New module for the `htseq-count` tool, often used in RNA-seq analysis.
- [**Prokka**](http://www.vicbioinformatics.com/software.prokka.shtml) - new module!
  - Prokka is a software tool for the rapid annotation of prokaryotic genomes.
- [**Slamdunk**](http://t-neumann.github.io/slamdunk/) - new module!
  - Slamdunk is a software tool to analyze SLAMSeq data.
- [**Peddy**](https://github.com/brentp/peddy) - new module!
  - Peddy calculates genotype :: pedigree correspondence checks, ancestry checks and sex checks using VCF files.
- **Cutadapt**
  - Fixed bug in General Stats table number for old versions of cutadapt (pre v1.7)
  - Added support for _really_ old cutadapt logs (eg. v.1.2)
- **FastQC**
  - New plot showing total overrepresented sequence percentages.
  - New option to parse a file containing a theoretical GC curve to display in the background.
    - Human & Mouse Genome / Transcriptome curves bundled, or make your own using [fastqcTheoreticalGC](https://github.com/mikelove/fastqcTheoreticalGC). See the [MultiQC docs](http://multiqc.info/docs/#fastqc) for more information.
- **featureCounts**
  - Added parsing checks and catch failures for when non-featureCounts files are picked up by accident
- **GATK**
  - Fixed logger error in VariantEval module.
- **Picard**

  - New feature to customise coverage shown from `HsMetrics` in General Statistics table
    see the [docs](http://multiqc.info/docs/#picard) for info).
  - Fixed compatibility problem with output from `CollectMultipleMetrics` for `CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics`
- **Preseq**
  - Module now recognises output from `c_curve` mode.
- **RSeQC**
  - Made the gene body coverage plot show the percentage view by default
  - Made gene body coverage properly handle sample names
- **Samtools**
  - New module to show duplicate stats from `rmdup` logs
  - Fixed a couple of niggles in the idxstats plot
- **SnpEff**
  - Fixed swapped axis labels in the Variant Quality plot
- **STAR**
  - Fixed crash when there are 0 unmapped reads.
  - Sample name now taken from the directory name if no file prefix found.
- **Qualimap BamQC**
  - Add a line for pre-calculated reference genome GC content
  - Plot cumulative coverage for values above 50x, align with the coverage histogram.
  - New ability to customise coverage thresholds shown in General Statistics table
    (see the [docs](http://multiqc.info/docs/#qualimap) for info).

Core Updates:
- Support for _custom content_ (see top of release notes).
- New ninja report tool: make scatter plots of any two table columns!
- Plot data now saved in `multiqc_data` when 'flat' image plots are created
  - Allows you easily re-plot the data (eg. in Excel) for further downstream investigation
- Added _'Apply'_ button to Highlight / Rename / Hide.
  - These tools can become slow with large reports. This means that you can enter several
    things without having to wait for the report to replot each change.
- Report heatmaps can now be sorted by highlight
- New config options `decimalPoint_format` and `thousandsSep_format`
  - Allows you to change the default `1 234.56` number formatting for plots.
- New config option `top_modules` allows you to specify modules that should come at the top of the report
- Fixed bar plot bug where missing categories could shift data between samples
- Report title now printed in the side navigation
- Missing plot IDs added for easier plot exporting
- Stopped giving warnings about skipping directories (now a debug message)
- Added warnings in report about missing functionality for flat plots (exporting and toolbox)
- Export button has contextual text for images / data
- Fixed a bug where user config files were loaded twice
- Fixed bug where module order was random if `--module` or `--exclude` was used.
- Refactored code so that the order of modules can be changed in the user config
- Beefed up code + docs in scatter plots back end and multiple bar plots.
- Fixed a few back end nasties for Tables
  - Shared-key columns are no longer forced to share colour schemes
  - Fixed bug in lambda modified values when format string breaks
  - Supplying just data with no header information now works as advertised
- Improvements to back end code for bar plots
  - New `tt_decimals` and `tt_suffix` options for bar plots
  - Bar plots now support `yCeiling`, `yFloor` and `yMinRange`, as with line plots.
  - New option `hide_zero_cats:False` to force legends to be shown even when all data is 0
- General Stats _Showing x of y_ columns count is fixed on page load.
- Big code whitespace cleanup
