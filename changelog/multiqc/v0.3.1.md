Hotfix to patch a bug that I found immediately after submitting v0.3.0 - sorry! Took the opportunity to add a few more new things to sweeten the deal.

### Changelog
- Hotfix patch to fix broken FastQC module (wasn't finding `.zip` files properly)
- General Stats table colours now flat. Should improve browser speed.
- Empty rows now hidden if appear due to column removal in general stats
- FastQC Kmer plot removed until we have something better to show.
