A major rewrite of MultiQC, with a lot of stabilisation and sanitisation. Many new functions created in Python and JavaScript to handle common functions, making writing new modules much easier. New toolbox of features created for report, making it much more interactive.

Download `MultiQC_v0.2.app.zip` for the Mac OS X graphical tool. To run from the command line, download the zip of the code. Can also be installed directly with `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiqc/0.1):

```
pip install multiqc
```
