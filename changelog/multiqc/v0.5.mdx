Latest version of MultiQC. Key highlights are **big reports** (hundreds / thousands of samples now possible), numerous **new modules**, better **plugin framework** and a bunch of tweaks for smoother running.

Changelog:
- New [Skewer](https://github.com/relipmoc/skewer) module, written by @dakl
- New [Samblaster](https://github.com/GregoryFaust/samblaster) module, written by @dakl
- New [Samtools stats](http://www.htslib.org/) module, written by @lpantano
- New [HiCUP](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/) module
- New [SnpEff](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/) module
- New [methylQA](http://methylqa.sourceforge.net/) module
- New "Flat" image plots, rendered at run time with MatPlotLib
  - By default, will use image plots if > 50 samples (set in config as `plots_flat_numseries`)
  - Means that _very_ large numbers of samples can be viewed in reports. _eg._ single cell data.
  - Templates can now specify their own plotting functions
  - Use `--flat` and `--interactive` to override this behaviour
- MultiQC added to `bioconda` (with help from @dakl)
- New plugin hook: `config_loaded`
- Plugins can now add new command line options (thanks to @robinandeer)
- Changed default data directory name from `multiqc_report_data` to `multiqc_data`
- Removed support for depreciated MultiQC_OSXApp
- Updated logging so that a verbose `multiqc_data/.multiqc.log` file is always written
- Now logs more stuff in verbose mode - command used, user configs and so on.
- Added a call to multiqc.info to check for new versions. Disable with config `no_version_check`
- Removed general stats manual row sorting.
- Made filename matching use glob unix style filename match patterns
- Everything (including the data directory) is now created in a temporary directory and moved when MultiQC is complete.
- A handful of performance updates for large analysis directories
