## [MultiQC v1.24.1](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/releases/tag/v1.24.1) - 2024-08-21

A bug fix release mainly to restore compatibility with Python 3.8. Aside from that, few other minor bug fixes:

- FastQC: fix long-standing issue misplacing status labels when `anchor` is specified in the custom config ([#2790](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/2790))
- Freyja: handle empty inputs, and ensure deterministic sample order ([#2788](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/2788))
- Allow numeric `xcats` and `ycats` for the heatmap plot ([#2787](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/2787))
- Make sure that config's `extra_fn_clean_exts` and `fn_clean_exts` don't conflict when both specified ([#2783](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/2783))
