#### CodeFest 2017 Contributions
We had a fantastic group effort on MultiQC at the [2017 BOSC CodeFest](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2017).
Many thanks to those involved!

#### New Modules:
* [**AfterQC**](https://github.com/OpenGene/AfterQC) - New module!
    * Added parsing of the _AfterQC_ json file data, with a plot of filtered reads.
    * Work by [@raonyguimaraes](https://github.com/raonyguimaraes)
* [**bcl2fastq**](https://support.illumina.com/downloads/bcl2fastq-conversion-software-v2-18.html)
    * bcl2fastq can be used to both demultiplex data and convert BCL files to FASTQ file formats for downstream analysis
    * New module parses JSON output from recent versions and summarises some key statistics from the demultiplexing process.
    * Work by [@iimog](https://github.com/iimog) (with a little help from [@tbooth](https://github.com/tbooth) and [@ewels](https://github.com/ewels))
* [**leeHom**](https://github.com/grenaud/leeHom)
    * leeHom is a program for the Bayesian reconstruction of ancient DNA
* [**VCFTools**](https://vcftools.github.io)
    * Added initial support for VCFTools `relatedness2`
    * Added support for VCFTools `TsTv-by-count` `TsTv-by-qual` `TsTv-summary`
    * Module written by [@mwhamgenomics](https://github.com/mwhamgenomics)

#### Module updates:
* **FastQ Screen**
    * Gracefully handle missing data from very old FastQ Screen versions.
* **RNA-SeQC**
    * Add new transcript-associated reads plot.
* **Picard**
    * New submodule to handle output from `TargetedPcrMetrics`
* **Prokka**
    * Added parsing of the `# CRISPR arrays` data from Prokka when available ([@asetGem](https://github.com/asetGem))
* **Qualimap**
    * Some code refactoring to radically improve performance and run times, especially with high coverage datasets.
    * Fixed bug where _Cumulative coverage genome fraction_ plot could be truncated.

#### New MultiQC Features:
* New module help text
    * Lots of additional help text was written to make MultiQC report plots easier to interpret.
    * Updated modules:
        * Bowtie
        * Bowtie 2
        * Prokka
        * Qualimap
        * SnpEff
    * Elite team of help-writers:
        * [@tabwalsh](https://github.com/tabwalsh)
        * [@ddesvillechabrol](https://github.com/tabwalsh)
        * [@asetGem](https://github.com/asetGem)
* New config option `section_comments` allows you to add custom comments above specific sections in the report
* New `--tags` and `--view_tags` command line options
    * Modules can now be given tags (keywords) and filtered by those. So running `--tags RNA` will only run MultiQC modules related to RNA analysis.
    * Work by [@Hammarn](https://github.com/Hammarn)
* Back-end configuration options to specify the order of table columns
    * Modules and user configs can set priorities for columns to customise where they are displayed
    * Work by [@tbooth](https://github.com/tbooth)
* Added framework for proper unit testing
    * Previous start on unit tests tidied up, new blank template and tests for the `clean_sample_name` functionality.
    * Added to Travis and Appveyor for continuous integration testing.
    * Work by [@tbooth](https://github.com/tbooth)
* Bug fixes and refactoring of report configuration saving / loading
    * Discovered and fixed a bug where a report config could only be loaded once
    * Work by [@DennisSchwartz](https://github.com/DennisSchwartz)
* Table column row headers (sample names) can now be numeric-only.
    * Work by [@iimog](https://github.com/iimog)
* Improved sample name cleaning functionality
    * Added option `regex_keep` to clean filenames by _keeping_ the matching part of a pattern
    * Work by [@robinandeer](https://github.com/robinandeer)
* Handle error when invalid regexes are given in reports
    * Now have a nice toast error warning you and the invalid regexes are highlighted
    * Previously this just crashed the whole report without any warning
    * Work by [@robinandeer](https://github.com/robinandeer)
* Command line option `--dirs-depth` now sets `-d` to `True` (so now works even if `-d` isn't also specified).
* New config option `config.data_dump_file` to export as much data as possible to `multiqc_data/multiqc_data.json`
* New code to send exported JSON data to a a web server
    * This is in preparation for the upcoming MegaQC project. Stay tuned!

#### Bug Fixes:
* Specifying multiple config files with `-c`/`--config` now works as expected
    * Previously this would only read the last specified
* Fixed table rendering bug that affected Chrome v60 and IE7-11
    * Table cell background bars weren't showing up. Updated CSS to get around this rendering error.
* HTML ID cleanup now properly cleans strings so that they work with jQuery as expected.
* Made bar graph sample highlighting work properly again
* Config `custom_logo` paths can now be relative to the config file (or absolute as before)
* Report doesn't keep annoyingly telling you that toolbox changes haven't been applied
    * Now uses more subtle _toasts_ and only when you close the toolbox (not every click).
* Switching report toolbox options to regex mode now enables the _Apply_ button as it should.
* Sorting table columns with certain suffixes (eg. `13X`) no works properly (numerically)
* Fixed minor bug in line plot data smoothing (now works with unsorted keys)
