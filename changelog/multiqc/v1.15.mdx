## Big speedup in file search step

This release of MultiQC introduces speed improvements to the file search (~5-7x fold improvement) ðŸŽ‰ 

One way it does this is by limiting the number of lines loaded by each search pattern. For the vast majority of users, this should have no effect except faster searches. However, in some edge cases **it may introduce some breaking changes**. Hypothetically, for example:

- If you concatenate log files from multiple tools
- If you have a custom plugin module that we haven't tested

See the [troubleshooting docs](https://multiqc.info/docs/usage/troubleshooting/#long-log-files) for more information.

### MultiQC updates

- Refactor file search for performance improvements ([#1904](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/pull/1904))
- Bump `log_filesize_limit` default (to skip large files in the search) from 10MB to 50MB.
- Table code now tolerates lambda function calls with bad data ([#1739](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues/1739))
- Beeswarm plot now saves data to `multiqc_data`, same as tables ([#1861](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues/1861))
- Don't print DOI in module if it's set to an empty string.
- Don't sort table headers alphabetically if we don't have an `OrderedDict` - regular dicts are fine in Py3 ([#1866](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues/1866))
- New back-end to preview + deploy the new website when the docs are edited.
- Fixed a _lot_ of broken links in the documentation from the new website change in structure.
