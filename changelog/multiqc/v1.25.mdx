### Highlights - sample grouping

New feature: grouping samples in the General Statistics table.

Some modules - prominently FastQC - may produce multiple results per sample, e.g. for the forward and the reverse reads. To group such results in the table together, a new [configuration option](https://multiqc.info/docs/reports/customisation/#sample-grouping) is introduced.

This feature is currently opt-in, you'll need to set `table_sample_merge` in a MultiQC config file to use (see docs above). **We'd love to hear your feedback!** We hope to enable it by default for common file suffix patterns in a future release.

Because MultiQC needs to know how to merge each column (sum, average, etc), each module must implement it independently. Currently it's supported by the FastQC and Cutadapt modules. If you'd like support added to another module, please let us know in a GitHub issue. Details of how to add it into module code can be found in the [moduel development documentation](https://multiqc.info/docs/development/modules/#grouping-samples).

### Highlights - box plots in custom content

The new box plot plot type, added in v1.21, are now available to use with custom content! See [2847](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/2847) for configuration examples.

### Refactoring and typing

- Separate anchors and IDs for sections: use IDs for Python configation, and anchors in HTML ([#2797](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/2797), [#2833](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/2833))
- Prefix table column IDs with namespace, but allow configuration to use both short and long anchors ([#2818](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/2818))
