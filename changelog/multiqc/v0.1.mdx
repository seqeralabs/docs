The first public release of MultiQC, after a month of development. Basic structure in place and modules for FastQC, FastQ Screen, Cutadapt, Bismark, STAR, Bowtie, Subread featureCounts and Picard MarkDuplicates. Approaching stability, though still under fairly heavy development.

Download `MultiQC.app.zip` for the Mac OS X graphical tool. To run from the command line, download the zip of the code. Can also be installed directly with `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiqc/0.1):

```
pip install multiqc
```
