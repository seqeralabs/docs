This is a relatively small release focussing just on bug fixes üêõ  - the last release revealed a couple of nasty ones which I felt were bad enough to justify a fast patch.. _(99 bugs - fix 1, now you've got 103 bugs)_

Many thanks to everyone who reports these problems along with example data üïµüèª 

### MultiQC updates

- Allow scientific notation numbers in colour scheme generation
  - Fixed bug with very small minimum numbers that only revelead itself after a bugfix done in the v1.10 release
- Require at least `rich` version `9.4.0` to avoid `SpinnerColumn` `AttributeError` ([#1393](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues/1393))
- Dropped the `Skipping search pattern` log message from a warning to debug
- Moved directory prepending with `-d` back to before sample name cleaning (as it was before v1.7) ([#1264](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues/1264))
- If linegraph plot data goes above `ymax`, only _discard_ the data if the line doesn't come back again ([#1257](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues/1257))
- Allow `top_modules` to be specified as empty dicts ([#1274](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues/1274))
- Properly ignore `.snakemake` folders as intended ([#1395](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues/1395))
