A slightly earlier-than-expected release due to a new problem with dependency packages that is breaking MultiQC installations since 2018-01-11.

#### New Modules:
* [**Sargasso**](http://statbio.github.io/Sargasso/)
    * Parses output from Sargasso - a tool to separate mixed-species RNA-seq reads according to their species of origin
    * Module written by [@hxin](https://github.com/hxin/)
* [**VerifyBAMID**](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/VerifyBamID)
    * Parses output from VerifyBAMID - a tool to detect contamination in BAM files.
    * Adds the `CHIPMIX` and `FREEMIX` columns to the general statistics table.
    * Module written by [@aledj2](https://github.com/aledj2/)

#### Module updates:
* **MACS2**
    * Updated to work with output from older versions of MACS2 by [@avilella](https://github.com/avilella/)
* **Peddy**
    * Add het check plot to suggest potential contamination by [@aledj2](https://github.com/aledj2)
* **Picard**
    * Picard HsMetrics `HS_PENALTY` plot now has correct axis labels
    * InsertSizeMetrics switches commas for points if it can't convert floats. Should help some european users.
* **QoRTs**
    * Added support for new style of output generated in the v1.3.0 release
* **Qualimap**
    * New `Error rate` column in General Statistics table, added by [@Cashalow](https://github.com/Cashalow/)
        * Hidden by default - customise your MultiQC config to always show this column (see [docs](http://multiqc.info/docs/#hiding-columns))
* **QUAST**
    * New option to customise the default display of contig count and length (eg. `bp` instead of `Mbp`).
    * See [documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#quast). Written by [@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/) and [@Cashalow](https://github.com/Cashalow/)
* **RSeQC**
    * Removed normalisation in Junction Saturation plot. Now raw counts instead of % of total junctions.

#### New MultiQC Features:
* Conditional formatting / highlighting of cell contents in tables
    * If you want to make values that match a criteria stand out more, you can now write custom rules and formatting instructions for tables.
    * For instructions, see [the documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#conditional-formatting)
* New `--lint` option which is strict about best-practices for writing new modules
    * Useful when writing new modules and code as it throws warnings
    * Currently only implemented for bar plots and a few other places. More linting coming soon...
* If MultiQC breaks and shows am error message, it now reports the filename of the last log it found
    * Hopefully this will help with debugging / finding dodgy input data

#### Bug Fixes
* Addressed new dependency error with conflicting package requirements
    * There was a conflict between the `networkx`, `colormath` and `spectra` releases.
    * I previously forced certain software versions to get around this, but `spectra` has now updated with the unfortunate effect of introducing a new dependency clash that halts installation.
* Fixed newly introduced bug where Custom Content MultiQC config file search patterns had been broken
* Updated pandoc command used in `--pdf` to work with new releases of Pandoc
* Made config `table_columns_visible` module name key matching case insensitive to make less frustrating
