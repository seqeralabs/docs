This release really has one really major change in it:

- Bootstrap upgrade and DARK MODE ([#3264](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/pull/3264))

This has been brewing for a long time, and is a large rewrite of how MultiQC HTML / CSS and JS is written and packaged.

MultiQC now supports simple theming with [Bootstrap colour modes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/color-modes/), and the updated `default` template ships with both light- and dark-mode by default ðŸ˜Ž

The old template is still available, but has been renamed to `original`.
