#### New Modules:

* [**BioBloom Tools**](https://github.com/bcgsc/biobloom)
    * Create Bloom filters for a given reference and then to categorize sequences
* [**Conpair**](https://github.com/nygenome/Conpair)
    * Concordance and contamination estimator for tumorâ€“normal pairs
* [**Disambiguate**](https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/disambiguate)
    * Bargraph displaying the percentage of reads aligning to two different reference genomes.
* [**Flexbar**](https://github.com/seqan/flexbar)
    * Flexbar is a tool for flexible barcode and adapter removal.
* [**HISAT2**](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/)
    * New module for the HISAT2 aligner.
    * Made possible by updates to HISAT2 logging by @infphilo (requires `--new-summary` HISAT2 flag).
* [**HOMER**](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/)
    * Support for summary statistics from the `findPeaks` tool.
* [**Jellyfish**](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/)
    * Histograms to estimate library complexity and coverage from k-mer content.
    * Module written by @vezzi
* [**MACS2**](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS)
    * Summary of redundant rate from MACS2 peak calling.
* [**QoRTs**](http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/)
    * QoRTs is toolkit for analysis, QC and data management of RNA-Seq datasets.
* [**THetA2**](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/theta/)
    * THeTA2 _(Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis)_ estimates tumour purity and clonal / subclonal copy number.

#### Module updates:

* **BCFtools**
    * Option to collapse complementary changes in substitutions plot, useful for non-strand specific experiments (thanks to @vladsaveliev)
* **Bismark**
    * M-Bias plots no longer show read 2 for single-end data.
* **Custom Content**
    * New option to print raw HTML content to the report.
* **FastQ Screen**
    * Fixed edge-case bug where many-sample plot broke if total number of reads was less than the subsample number.
    * Fixed incorrect logic of config option `fastqscreen_simpleplot` (thanks to @daler)
    * Organisms now alphabetically sorted in fancy plot so that order is nonrandom (thanks to @daler)
    * Fixed bug where `%No Hits` was missed in logs from recent versions of FastQ Screen.
* **HTSeq Counts**
    * Fixed but so that module still works when `--additional-attr` is specified in v0.8 HTSeq above (thanks to @nalcala)
* **Picard**
    * CollectInsertSize: Fixed bug that could make the General Statistics _Median Insert Size_ value incorrect.
    * Fixed error in sample name regex that left trailing `]` characters and was generally broken (thanks to @jyh1 for spotting this)
* **Preseq**
    * Improved plots display (thanks to @vladsaveliev)
* **Qualimap**
    * Only calculate bases over target coverage for values in General Statistics. Should give a speed increase for very high coverage datasets.
* **QUAST**
    * Module is now compatible with runs from [MetaQUAST](http://quast.sourceforge.net/metaquast) (thanks to @vladsaveliev)
* **RSeQC**
    * Changed default order of sections
    * Added config option to reorder and hide module report sections

#### New MultiQC features:

* If a report already exists, execution is no longer halted.
    * `_1` is appended to the filename, iterating if this also exists.
    * `-f`/`--force` still overwrites existing reports as before
    * Feature written by [@Hammarn](https://github.com/Hammarn)
* New ability to run modules multiple times in a single report
    * Each run can be given different configuration options, including filters for input files
    * For example, have FastQC after trimming as well as FastQC before trimming.
    * See the relevant [documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#order-of-modules) for more instructions.
* New option to customise the order of report _sections_
    * This is in addition / alternative to changing the order of module execution
    * Allows one module to have sections in multiple places (eg. Custom Content)
* Tables have new column options `floor`, `ceiling` and `minRange`.
* Reports show warning if JavaScript is disabled
* Config option `custom_logo` now works with file paths relative to config file directory and cwd.

#### Bug Fixes:

* Table headers now sort columns again after scrolling the table
* Fixed buggy table header tooltips
* Base `clean_s_name` function now strips excess whitespace.
* Line graphs don't smooth lines if not needed (number of points < maximum number allowed)
* PDF output now respects custom output directory.
