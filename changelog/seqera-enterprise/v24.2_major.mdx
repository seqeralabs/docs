Seqera Enterprise version 24.2 introduces a number of new features to Data Studios, the addition of the global Nextflow config, as well as a number of bug fixes and performance enhancements.

## New features and improvements


### Nextflow

  - Add global Nextflow config: ability to define the Nextflow config in the CE as a "global" configuration. The configuration defined in the pipeline config and at launch level, can override the one defined in the CE config.
  - global nextflow config and managed identity client ID copy fixes (#7495)

### Launchpad

- New Launch Form is enabled by default. If you've activated the new launch form already using the environment variable `TOWER_STEPPED_LAUNCH_FORM_ALLOWED_WORKSPACES`, nothing will change. If you have not yet activated it, it will show by default. You can disable this per workspace, or across your entire deployment (empty, null, comma-separated). When `null` (undefined) ->  no workspaces are enabled, when empty -> all are enabled
- Implement custom launch container logic (#7298) (probably not needed...let's check on  this)
- Improve error message on launchpad if the branch is missing (#7772)
- adds tags propagation to launch template (#7429)

### Runs

- N/A

### Datasets

- N/A

### Data Explorer 

- Add direct Data Explorer browse link to mounted data items, so that I can easily inspect the data used in a session.

### Data Studios
 
 - Data Studios custom environments
    - Create custom analysis environments or link to publicly/privately hosted ECR container. 
    - Custom environment build events are now added to the auditlog. This captures custom environment builds in the audit log to give you insight into how often, and which, custom environments are created. The events `data_studio_session_build_started` and `data_studio_session_build_failed` are added to the `tw_audit_log` table.
- Data Studios dashboard 
    -  New [dashboard](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/24.2/monitoring/dashboard#data-studios) provides information about Data Studios usage which can help you manage your resources.
  - Hybrid compute enviroments now supported in Data Studios.
    - Optionally define GPU allocation when creating a Data Studios session.
  - NVMe support added.

### Compute Environments

- AWS Forge support has been added for Amazon Linux 2023. Previously AWS Forge was only able to create CE that was compatible with AL2. Seqera now supports Amazon Linux 2023 - and if you specify an AMI ID then it spins up the right one. This does not change the defaults. It's not possible to specify as an image in the Forge setup. (#7734)
- Google Life Sciences API deprecation notice has been added to the to Seqera Platform UI. The Google Life Sciences API will be deprecated in June 2025.

### Credentials 

- Azure Batch service principal creds and managed identities prevents spillover of credentials, and config needs to be done. 
- Remove required validator from GitLab credentials password field (#7752)
- Update Kubernetes credentials form UI (#7587)

### Secrets

- N/A

### Participants 

- N/A

### Settings

- Added flexibility for pipeline names in workspaces (#7272)

## Breaking changes and warnings

Replace /redisson/* references for the AWS parameter store with TOWER_REDIS_*. Replace redisson.* references for the tower.yml with TOWER_REDIS_*. Setting TOWER_REDIS_* values directly in the YAML file (for example, TOWER_REDIS_URL: redis://...) in tower.yml is feasible.
