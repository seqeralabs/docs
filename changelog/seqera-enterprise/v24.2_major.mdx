Seqera Platform Enterprise version 24.2 introduces a number of new features to Data Studios, the addition of the global Nextflow config, as well as a number of bug fixes and performance enhancements.

## New features

- Data Studios
  - New telemetry metrics for Data Studio and improved metrics telemetry for signin
  - Data Studios build events are now added to the auditlog. This captures custom environment builds in the audit log to give you insight into how often, and which, custom environments are created. The events `data_studio_session_build_started` and `data_studio_session_build_failed` are added to the `tw_audit_log` table.
  - New [data studios dashboard](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/24.2/monitoring/dashboard#data-studios) provides information about Data Studios usage which can help you manage your resources.
  - GPU resource definition for data studios (#7695)
  - Add direct Data Explorer browse link to mounted data items, so that I can easily inspect the data used in my session.
- Nextflow
  - Add global Nextflow config: ability to define the Nextflow config in the CE as a "global" configuration. The configuration defined in the pipeline config and at launch level, can override the one defined in the CE config.

## Breaking changes and warnings

Replace /redisson/* references for the AWS parameter store with TOWER_REDIS_*.
Replace redisson.* references for the tower.yml with TOWER_REDIS_*. Setting TOWER_REDIS_* values directly in the YAML file (for example, TOWER_REDIS_URL: redis://...) in tower.yml is feasible.
