Seqera Platform Enterprise version 25.3 introduces a series of enhancements.

### New features and improvements

#### Custom roles and fine-grained authorization (RBAC) - preview

Seqera now supports custom roles with fine-grained permissions, allowing organizations to define specific access controls beyond the predefined Owner, Admin, Maintain, Launch, View, and Connect roles. Behind `FINE_GRAINED_AUTHORIZATION` feature toggle. This feature is currently in preview.

- Create Custom Roles
- Update Custom Roles
- List and Describe Custom Roles
- Grant Management
- RBAC Integration

#### Studios

Studios received significant improvements for Git repository integration and container build processes, enhancing support for both public and private repositories.

##### Git provider integration

- Extended Studios Git configuration to support additional clone parameters, including commit ID pinning and automatic default branch selection when no revision is specified. This provides more flexibility in how Studios pull code from repositories.

#### Data Explorer

- LakeFS Cloud Support: Added LakeFS cloud to the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) configuration, enabling full Data Explorer functionality for LakeFS object storage. Users can now browse, manage, and interact with data stored in LakeFS repositories directly from the Platform.
- Support for S3 compatible HPC storage.

#### Compute environment 

**Job management improvements**
 - Unschedulable Job Termination: Configured Nextflow to automatically terminate unschedulable jobs on AWS Batch compute environments by setting aws.batch.terminateUnschedulableJobs to true by default. This prevents jobs that cannot be scheduled (due to invalid resource requests or configuration errors) from indefinitely blocking the job queue, improving overall compute environment reliability and resource utilization.
 - Unschedulable Job Queue Prevention: Implemented safeguards to prevent unschedulable jobs from blocking other jobs in the queue. When jobs cannot be scheduled due to resource constraints or configuration errors, they are handled separately to ensure other valid jobs can proceed.
- AWS G6e Instance Family Support: Added the AWS g6e instance family (NVIDIA L40S GPUs) to the NVMe disk support list, enabling high-performance local storage for GPU-accelerated workloads.

#### Pipeline versioning

#### Run details improvements

#### Nextflow launcher image

If you must host your nf-launcher container image on a private image registry, copy the [nf-launcher](https://quay.io/repository/seqeralabs/nf-launcher?tab=tags) image to your private registry. Then update your `tower.env` with the following environment variable:

`TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER=<FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_IMAGE>`

If you're using AWS Batch, you will need to configure a custom job-definition and populate the `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER` with the job-definition name instead.

#### Fusion

#### Wave
