Seqera Platform Enterprise version 25.3 introduces a series of new features and enhancements including custom user roles, Studios integration with Git, and pipeline versioning.

### New features and improvements

#### Custom roles and fine-grained authorization (RBAC)

- Added support for custom roles with fine-grained permissions, to define specific access controls beyond the predefined Owner, Admin, Maintain, Launch, View, and Connect roles. 
- Added endpoint to create custom roles.
- Added endpoint to update custom role definitions.
- Added endpoint to describe and list custom roles.
- Added grant listing controller and service methods.
- Integrated grants into application-level RBAC.

#### Studios

- Added Git repository integration to **Add Studio** page, supporting private and public repos.
- Added the ability to configure custom clone paths for Git repositories in Studios. 
- Added clone parameters to Studio Git config including commit ID pinning and automatic default branch selection when no revision is specified.
- Added the ability to fetch and create Docker build context asynchronously before Wave submission.
- Added CSP config for LakeFS cloud integration.
- Added the ability to launch Studios with an iframe served by Connect. To enable this, use the `TOWER_DATA_STUDIO_ENABLE_CONNECT_IFRAME` environment variable. 
- Added the ability to stop a Studio session that is stuck starting without needing AWS console access.

#### Pipeline versioning

- Added [pipeline revision management and versioning](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/pipelines/overview#key-features) to pipeline launches.
- Added support for tracking and launching specific versions of pipeline configurations.
- Added the ability for users to create, save, and reference pipeline versions from edit or launch.
- Added role-based permissions to pipeline version management.

#### Seqera AI

- Added the ability to debug a pipeline via the Seqera AI chat interface. 
- Added the ability to create a new data sheet via the Seqera AI chat interface. 

#### Datasets

- Enhanced dataset management with an updated details page.
- Added the ability to hide/show datasets and disable specific dataset versions for better dataset lifecycle management.
- Added support for dataset labels to improve organization and categorization of datasets within workspaces.
- Added the ability to filter pipeline runs by dataset ID using the datasetId: search keyword, improving traceability between datasets and workflows.

#### Data Explorer

- Made S3 bucket metadata requests optional for non-AWS S3-compatible APIs.
- Added fallback mechanism for labels on /launch endpoint.
- Added support for S3 compatible HPC storage.
- Added support for LakeFS Cloud in Data Explorer by enabling image preview and file upload functionality when using LakeFS Cloud as an S3-compatible storage provider.

#### Compute

- Configured Nextflow to automatically terminate unschedulable jobs on AWS Batch compute environments by setting `aws.batch.terminateUnschedulableJobs` to `true` by default. This prevents jobs that cannot be scheduled (due to invalid resource requests or configuration errors) from indefinitely blocking the job queue.
- Implemented safeguards to prevent unschedulable jobs from blocking other jobs in the queue. When jobs cannot be scheduled due to resource constraints or configuration errors, they are handled separately to ensure other valid jobs can proceed.
- Added the AWS `g6e` instance family (NVIDIA L40S GPUs) to the NVMe disk support list, enabling high-performance local storage for GPU-accelerated workloads.
- Improved AWS Batch workflow behavior to automatically terminate unschedulable jobs instead of leaving them pending indefinitely.
- Added `f2.6xlarge`, `f2.12xlarge`, `f2.48xlarge` instance types.
- Extended Google Cloud config with selectable Advanced options - `machineType`, `image`, `armEnabled`.

#### Nextflow launcher image

If you must host your nf-launcher container image on a private image registry, copy the [nf-launcher](https://quay.io/repository/seqeralabs/nf-launcher?tab=tags) image to your private registry. Then update your `tower.env` with the following environment variable:

`TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER=<FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_IMAGE>`

If you're using AWS Batch, you will need to configure a custom job-definition and populate the `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER` with the job-definition name instead.

### General

- The Platform top navigation has been replaced with a sidebar for improved navigation.
- Centralized workspace settings permissions.
- Updated Platform behavior to redirect to first available sidenav item instead of hardcoded launchpad.
- Added reusable `LabelValueComponent` for consistent UI.
- Added usage statistics to the Datasets API, allowing you to view the number of pipeline runs using each dataset and when it was last used.
- Added metrics to confirm whether a pipeline is running GPU resources.
- Added better support for treating Nextflow config preferentially, as mono-repo configurations are now read from the same directory as the configured main script.
- Added support for BitBucket API tokens to ensure that Bitbucket can still be used as an API provider. See the announcement for more information: [https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed Studios AWS cloud private ECR pull issues.
- Fixed handling of Studios tokens without user ID claim.
- Fixed MultiQC plots displaying as grey boxes.
- Fixed badge cropping issues in Platform UI.
- Fixed infinite scroll in optimization profile modal.
- Removed blanket `ListOrganizationSettings` check, use individual permissions instead.
- Added proper permission checks for workflow star functionality.
- Forced perfect circle avatar shape for consistent rendering.
- Fixed pipeline list not updating when changing workspace.
- Prevented incorrect `workdir` patching when resuming workflow with compute environment changes.
- Fixed pipeline config reading from same directory as main script.
- Fixed error when saving long container names.
- Fixed trigger YAML validation on Studios config patch.
- Fixed `describePipeline` to properly handle avatar files.
- Fixed transactional event listener annotation for compute operations.
- Improved Connect parameter handling for compute environments.
- Fixed OIDC API handling in authentication flows.

### General warnings

### Upgrade steps

This release maintains backward compatibility with version 25.2.x.

:::note
- Make a backup of your Platform database prior to upgrade.
- If you are upgrading from a version prior to 25.1, complete all intermediate major version upgrades before upgrading to 25.3.
- Ensure that no pipelines are in a running state during this upgrade as active run data may be lost.
