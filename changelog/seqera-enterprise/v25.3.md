Seqera Platform Enterprise version 25.3 introduces a series of enhancements.

### New features and improvements

#### Custom roles and fine-grained authorization (RBAC) - preview

Seqera now supports custom roles with fine-grained permissions, allowing organizations to define specific access controls beyond the predefined Owner, Admin, Maintain, Launch, View, and Connect roles. Behind `FINE_GRAINED_AUTHORIZATION` feature toggle. This feature is currently in preview.

- **Create Custom Roles**: Added endpoint to create custom roles
- **Update Custom Roles**: Added endpoint to update custom role definitions
- **List Custom Roles**: Added endpoint to describe and list custom roles
- **Grant Management**: Added grant listing controller and service methods
- **RBAC Integration**: Integrated grants into application-level RBAC

#### Studios

Studios received significant improvements for Git repository integration and container build processes, enhancing support for both public and private repositories.

- **Git Integration**: Generate and pass ephemeral URLs to fetch git credentials for studios
- **Docker Build Context**: Fetch and create docker build context asynchronously before Wave submission
- **Git Config Parameters**: Added clone parameters to studio git config
- **LakeFS Cloud Support**: Added CSP config for LakeFS cloud integration

##### Git provider integration

- Extended Studios Git configuration to support additional clone parameters, including commit ID pinning and automatic default branch selection when no revision is specified. This provides more flexibility in how Studios pull code from repositories.
- LakeFS Cloud Support: Added LakeFS cloud to the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) configuration, enabling full Data Explorer functionality for LakeFS object storage. Users can now browse, manage, and interact with data stored in LakeFS repositories directly from the Platform.
- Support for S3 compatible HPC storage.

#### Data Explorer
- **Non-AWS S3 Support**: Made S3 bucket metadata requests optional for non-AWS S3-compatible APIs
- **Label Fallback**: Added fallback mechanism for labels on /launch endpoint

#### Compute environment 

### Compute Environment Features
- **Unschedulable Job Management**Unschedulable Job Termination: Configured Nextflow to automatically terminate unschedulable jobs on AWS Batch compute environments by setting aws.batch.terminateUnschedulableJobs to true by default. This prevents jobs that cannot be scheduled (due to invalid resource requests or configuration errors) from indefinitely blocking the job queue, improving overall compute environment reliability and resource utilization.
- **Job Queue Optimization** Implemented safeguards to prevent unschedulable jobs from blocking other jobs in the queue. When jobs cannot be scheduled due to resource constraints or configuration errors, they are handled separately to ensure other valid jobs can proceed.
- **G6e Instance Support** Added the AWS g6e instance family (NVIDIA L40S GPUs) to the NVMe disk support list, enabling high-performance local storage for GPU-accelerated workloads.

#### Pipeline Versioning
- **Pipeline Schema Enhancements**: Added PipelineSchema entity with user/workspace and Launch relationships
- **Version Indexing**: Implemented pipeline version indexing
- **Launch Hash Algorithm**: Extended Launch version hash column for algorithm prefix

#### Run details improvements

#### Nextflow launcher image

If you must host your nf-launcher container image on a private image registry, copy the [nf-launcher](https://quay.io/repository/seqeralabs/nf-launcher?tab=tags) image to your private registry. Then update your `tower.env` with the following environment variable:

`TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER=<FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_IMAGE>`

If you're using AWS Batch, you will need to configure a custom job-definition and populate the `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER` with the job-definition name instead.

#### Fusion

#### Wave

### Upgrade steps

This release maintains backward compatibility with version 25.2.x.

:::note
- Make a backup of your Platform database prior to upgrade.
- If you are upgrading from a version prior to 25.1, complete all intermediate major version upgrades before upgrading to 25.2.
- Ensure that no pipelines are in a running state during this upgrade as active run data may be lost.
