Seqera Platform Enterprise version 25.3 introduces a series of enhancements.

### New features and improvements

#### Custom roles and fine-grained authorization (RBAC)

Seqera now supports custom roles with fine-grained permissions, allowing organizations to define specific access controls beyond the predefined Owner, Admin, Maintain, Launch, View, and Connect roles. 

- **Create custom roles**: Added endpoint to create custom roles
- **Update custom roles**: Added endpoint to update custom role definitions
- **List custom roles**: Added endpoint to describe and list custom roles
- **Grant management**: Added grant listing controller and service methods
- **RBAC integration**: Integrated grants into application-level RBAC

#### Studios

Studios received significant improvements for Git repository integration and container build processes, enhancing support for both public and private repositories.

- **Git integration**
  - Added the ability to configure custom clone paths for Git repositories in Studios, providing more flexibility in organizing repository files within your Studio environment.
  - Added clone parameters to Studio Git config including commit ID pinning and automatic default branch selection when no revision is specified. This provides more flexibility in how Studios pull code from repositories.
- **Docker build context**: Added the ability to fetch and create Docker build context asynchronously before Wave submission.
- **LakeFS cloud support**: Added CSP config for LakeFS cloud integration.

#### Data Explorer

- **Non-AWS S3 support**: Made S3 bucket metadata requests optional for non-AWS S3-compatible APIs
- **Label fallback**: Added fallback mechanism for labels on /launch endpoint
- **Support for S3 compatible HPC storage**. 
- **LakeFS support**: Added support for LakeFS Cloud in Data Explorer by enabling image preview and file upload functionality when using LakeFS Cloud as an S3-compatible storage provider.

#### Compute environments

- **Unschedulable job management**: Configured Nextflow to automatically terminate unschedulable jobs on AWS Batch compute environments by setting `aws.batch.terminateUnschedulableJobs` to `true` by default. This prevents jobs that cannot be scheduled (due to invalid resource requests or configuration errors) from indefinitely blocking the job queue.
- **Job queue optimization**: Implemented safeguards to prevent unschedulable jobs from blocking other jobs in the queue. When jobs cannot be scheduled due to resource constraints or configuration errors, they are handled separately to ensure other valid jobs can proceed.
- **G6e instance support**: Added the AWS g6e instance family (NVIDIA L40S GPUs) to the NVMe disk support list, enabling high-performance local storage for GPU-accelerated workloads.
- **Improved job failure handling in AWS Batch compute environments**: Improved AWS Batch workflow behavior to automatically terminate unschedulable jobs instead of leaving them pending indefinitely, providing faster feedback when compute resources are insufficient for workflow requirements.

#### Pipeline versioning

- **Pipeline schema enhancements**: Added `PipelineSchema` entity with user/workspace and Launch relationships.
- **Version indexing**: Implemented pipeline version indexing.

#### Run details

#### Nextflow launcher image

If you must host your nf-launcher container image on a private image registry, copy the [nf-launcher](https://quay.io/repository/seqeralabs/nf-launcher?tab=tags) image to your private registry. Then update your `tower.env` with the following environment variable:

`TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER=<FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_IMAGE>`

If you're using AWS Batch, you will need to configure a custom job-definition and populate the `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER` with the job-definition name instead.

#### Fusion

#### Wave

### General

**Platform improvements**

- **Permission centralization**: Centralized workspace settings permissions.
- **Permission reviews**: Comprehensive review and cleanup of orphaned permissions.
- **Navigation enhancement**: Redirect to first available sidenav item instead of hardcoded launchpad.
- **Detail section component**: Added reusable `LabelValueComponent` for consistent UI.

### Bug fixes

#### Studios fixes

- **AWS ECR pull**: Fixed Studios AWS cloud private ECR pull issues.
- **Studio token claims**: Fixed handling of Studios tokens without user ID claim.

#### Platform user interface fixes

- **MultiQC plots**: Fixed MultiQC plots displaying as grey boxes.
- **Badge cropping**: Fixed badge cropping issues in Platform UI.
- **Optimization profile modal**: Fixed infinite scroll in optimization profile modal.
- **Organization settings**: Removed blanket ListOrganizationSettings check, use individual permissions instead.
- **Workflow star permissions**: Added proper permission checks for workflow star functionality.
- **Avatar display**: Forced perfect circle avatar shape for consistent rendering.
- **Pipeline workspace change**: Fixed pipeline list not updating when changing workspace.
- **Work directory patching**: Prevented incorrect workdir patching when resuming workflow with compute environment changes.

#### Pipeline and workflow fixes

- **Pipeline config location** Fixed pipeline config reading from same directory as main script.
- **Container name length** Fixed error when saving long container names.
- **Template source type**: Fixed template source type patching.
- **Workflow deletion**: Added explicit sort to force deletion of older workflows first.
- **Dataset redirect**: Fixed redirect to dataset list when no versions retrieved.
- **YAML validation**: Fixed trigger YAML validation on Studios config patch.
- **Avatar file handling**: Fixed `describePipeline` to properly handle avatar files.

#### Database and migration fixes

- **Migration cleanup**: Deleted problematic m102 mysql patch and override migration files.
- **Database key issues**: Dropped problematic `UK_launch_pipeline_version_default` key.
- **Test coherence**: Fixed `MicronautTest` tests database coherence issues.
- **Timestamp tests**: Reduced flakiness in timestamp-based tests.

#### Compute environment fixes

- **Event listener**: Fixed transactional event listener annotation for compute operations.
- **Connect parameters**: Improved connect parameter handling for compute environments.
- **Upload scope**: Fixed null pointer exception when uploading from user scope.

#### Authentication and authorization

- **OIDC API auth**: Fixed OIDC API handling in authentication flows.

### General warnings

### Upgrade steps

This release maintains backward compatibility with version 25.2.x.

:::note
- Make a backup of your Platform database prior to upgrade.
- If you are upgrading from a version prior to 25.1, complete all intermediate major version upgrades before upgrading to 25.3.
- Ensure that no pipelines are in a running state during this upgrade as active run data may be lost.
