## Nextflow

### Nextflow upgraded to 25.10.2

Seqera Platform 25.3.1 includes Nextflow 25.10.2 (previously 25.04.8).

According to the [25.10.0](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases/tag/v25.10.0), [25.10.1](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases/tag/v25.10.1), and [25.10.2](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases/tag/v25.10.2) release notes, there are breaking changes for AWS configurations and the deprecated Google Life Sciences executor. However, existing pipelines will continue to work. New recommended syntax is now available:

**New features:**
- **Workflow params**: New `params` block for declaring pipeline parameters with type annotations (requires strict syntax)
- **Workflow outputs out of preview**: Workflow outputs are now production-ready (remove `nextflow.preview.output` flag if using)
- **Type annotations**: Support for type annotations on parameters, workflows, processes, and functions (requires strict syntax)
- **Auth and Launch commands**: New `nextflow auth` and `nextflow launch` commands for Seqera Platform integration

**Enhancements:**
- Nextflow plugin registry for more efficient plugin downloads
- Simpler syntax for workflow handlers (`onComplete`, `onError` sections in workflows)
- Simpler syntax for dynamic directives (no closure required with strict syntax)
- Configurable date formatting via `NXF_DATE_FORMAT` environment variable

**Breaking changes:**
- `google-lifesciences` executor removed (use `google-batch` instead)
- AWS Java SDK upgraded from v1 to v2 (affects `aws.client` config options)
- Package `nextflow.config.schema` renamed to `nextflow.config.spec`

See the [Nextflow 25.10 migration guide](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/migrations/25-10.html) for full details.

**Note:** The default Nextflow version can be overridden by setting `NXF_VER` in a [pre-run script](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.3/launch/advanced#pre-and-post-run-scripts):
```bash
export NXF_VER=25.04.8
```

### Nextflow launcher image

If you host your nf-launcher container image on a private image registry, copy the [nf-launcher](https://public.cr.seqera.io/repo/platform/nf-launcher) image to your private registry. Then update your `tower.env` with the following environment variable:

`TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER=<FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_IMAGE>`

If you're using AWS Batch, you will need to configure a custom job-definition and populate the `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER` with the job-definition name instead.
