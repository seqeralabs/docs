Seqera Platform Enterprise version 25.2 introduces a series of enhancements to improve security, observability, and flexibility.

## Feature updates and improvements

### Single instance cloud compute environments

Single instance compute environments create a single compute instance to execute Nextflow pipelines or run Studio sessions with a local executor. The new [AWS Cloud](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/compute-envs/aws-cloud) and [Google Cloud](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/compute-envs/google-cloud) compute environments are optimized for small to medium pipelines and Studios, enabling faster startup time, simplified configuration, and fewer cloud provider dependencies. To activate these, add `awscloud-platform` and `googlecloud-platform` to the `TOWER_ENABLE_PLATFORMS` [environment variable](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/enterprise/configuration/overview#compute-environments).

### Studios

##### Compute changes

- Studios now supports ARM64 architecture and Spot instances in [AWS Cloud](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/compute-envs/aws-cloud) and [Google Cloud](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/compute-envs/google-cloud) compute environments.
- AWS Cloud compute environments now support nested containerization:
  - VS Code Studios include a [Docker-in-Docker](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/studios/overview#docker-in-docker) configuration method, enabling you to run Nextflow directly.
  - The remaining Studios types support Docker via manual installation.
- Studios now supports [path-based routing](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/studios/overview#path-based-routingnon-wildcard-ssltls-certificates) to enable fixed domains for Studio sessions. This removes the need for a wildcard SSL/TLS certificate.
- You can now add per-session user-defined environment variables when creating a new Studio.

### Data Explorer

- Platform CLI now supports file upload and download operations.
- You can now upload multiple files and folders to your cloud bucket simultaneously.
- New labels display **read-only** and **public** buckets.

### Platform interface changes

- Replaced the Platform top navigation with a sidebar for improved navigation.
- The [pipeline run details](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/monitoring/run-details) page was refreshed with these improvements:
  - A progress bar provides a clear, dynamic view of pipeline execution in real time.
  - A dedicated **Run** info tab with a centralized view of run metadata and status details.
  - Improved navigation tabs for Tasks, Logs, Metrics, and Containers.
  - The **Tasks** tab is the default display for successful runs.

### Fusion

- Added Fusion Snapshots (beta) support in AWS Batch compute environments, enabling Fusion to automatically restore jobs interrupted by AWS Spot instance reclamation. See [Fusion Snapshots](https://docs.seqera.io/fusion/guide/snapshots) for more information.
- Fusion licensing enabled. A Fusion license sets a specific quota for Fusion use, measured by total pipeline throughput per month (defined by [Nextflow's I/O metrics](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tutorials/metrics.html#i-o-usage)). See [Fusion licensing](https://docs.seqera.io/fusion/licensing) for more information.
- Added a Platform Fusion usage dashboard.

### Audit logs

- GxP compliance: Expanded [audit log events](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/monitoring/audit-logs).
- Supported IPv6 addresses in audit log UI and API.
- Audit log API improvements:
  - Pagination improvements for enhanced performance. If you use the audit log admin API in your internal processes, [contact us](https://support.seqera.io) to mitigate any breaking changes to your script.
  - Time range filtering support.

## General

### Studios

- Added Conda helper text to the Conda packages field in **Add new Studio > General config**.

### Datasets

- Added `AuditLog` for dataset operations.
- Implemented support for multiple extension dataset parameters in the input form.
- Datasets with the same name can be stored within the same organization.
- Renamed `data_set_` prefixed events to `dataset_` for consistency with `Dataset` naming.

### Launchpad

- Added support for providing launch form values via [URL query parameters](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/launch/launchpad#populate-launch-form-with-url-query-parameters).
- Added support for markdown rendering for Nextflow object field `help_text` and `description` properties.
- Improved pipeline schema validation error messaging in launch form.
- Added support for `array` type parameters in the Launch form.

### Workflows

- Added **Aborted** task counts to run details.
- Updated on-hover copy for **Metrics** tab data widgets.

### Pipelines

- Pipeline revision form field formatting in Platform interface.
- Enabled revision control during fresh pipeline launch.

### Compute environments

- Upgraded Azure Batch Ubuntu image version to 22.04.
- Upgraded AWS SDK dependencies to v2.
- Renamed **Pipeline work directory** to **Work directory** in compute environment forms.
- Added P5, P5e, P6-b200, I7i, C8gd, M8gd and R8gd EC2 families that support NVMe disk. Learn more on the [AWS What's New](https://aws.amazon.com/new/) page.

### Data Explorer

- Added a confirmation dialogue to prevent accidental termination of uploads and downloads by navigating away from Data Explorer.

### API

- Added OpenAPI tags to endpoints.
- Added indexes to improve performance on some potentially slow queries.

## Bug fixes

### Pipelines

- Fixed pipeline secrets not being deleted in the context of a personal workspace.
- Fixed an issue when editing a pipeline, the logo changed to the organization logo.

### Workflows

- Fixed missing notifications on tasks in **Submitted** state.
- Fixed cost reporting metrics failing to render for runs launched with Nextflow CLI.
- Fixed empty state condition for containers in the task details screen when using a version of Nextflow that didn't have containerMeta support.
- Fixed discrepancy between **Wall time** and **total run duration**.

### Datasets

- Fixed content mime types causing overly restrictive dataset parameters.

### Data Explorer

- Added support for the `?` character in Data Explorer path and file names.

### Launchpad

- Improved launch parameters handling after pipeline revision or config profiles are changed. Revision or config profile changes now override existing parameters.
- Fixed an issue where parameters did not update on relaunch and removed/modified parameters persisted.

### Compute environments

- Resolved Google VM propagate instance creation errors.

### UI/UX

- Updated navigation bar link to Dashboard instead of Launchpad.
- Improved error message handling for requests that have `RequestOptions.responseType` explicitly specified.

## Nextflow

### Nextflow upgraded to 25.04.3

Seqera Platform 25.2 includes Nextflow 25.04.3 (previously 24.10.4).

According to the [25.04.0](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases/tag/v25.04.0) through [25.04.3](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases/tag/v25.04.3) release notes, this is a major update with new features and some breaking changes. However, existing pipelines will continue to work. New recommended syntax is now available:

**New features:**

- **Workflow params**: New `params` block for declaring pipeline parameters with type annotations (requires strict syntax)
- **Type annotations**: Support for type annotations on parameters, workflows, processes, and functions (requires strict syntax)
- **Simpler syntax**: Workflow handlers and dynamic directives no longer require closures with strict syntax enabled

**Breaking changes:**

- AWS Java SDK upgraded from v1 to v2 (affects `aws.client` config options)
- Package `nextflow.config.schema` renamed to `nextflow.config.spec`

See the [Nextflow 25.04 migration guide](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/migrations/25-04.html) for full details.

**Note:** The default Nextflow version can be overridden by setting `NXF_VER` in a [pre-run script](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/launch/advanced#pre-and-post-run-scripts):

```bash
export NXF_VER=24.10.4
```

### Nextflow launcher image

If you host your nf-launcher container image on a private image registry, copy the [nf-launcher](https://public.cr.seqera.io/repo/platform/nf-launcher) image to your private registry. Then update your `tower.env` with the following environment variable:

`TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER=<FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_IMAGE>`

If you're using AWS Batch, you will need to configure a custom job-definition and populate the `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER` with the job-definition name instead.

## General warnings

### Removed `maxSpotattempts` setting from Platform

Nextflow now handles this setting. See the [Nextflow reference documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/config.html) for more information.

### Legacy Seqera container image registry access ended June 1, 2025

You can no longer pull Seqera Enterprise container images from the legacy Seqera container registries (AWS ECR, GCP AR, Azure CR). All Seqera Enterprise images must be retrieved via the cr.seqera.io container registry. The installation and configuration templates provided for both Docker Compose and Kubernetes installations already reference the cr.seqera.io container image URLs. If you have not yet transitioned to this registry, contact Support to request credentials and for any further assistance.

See [Legacy Seqera container image registries](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/25.2/enterprise/advanced-topics/seqera-container-images) for more information on the deprecated Seqera AWS ECR registry.

## Upgrade steps

:::note

- Make a backup of your Platform database prior to upgrade.
- If you are upgrading from a version prior to 25.1, complete all intermediate major version upgrades before upgrading to 25.2.
- Ensure that no pipelines are in a running state during this upgrade as active run data may be lost.
