## New features and improvements

- **Studios**
  - Added three new configuration parameters for customizing Docker image naming conventions in Studios Wave integration.
  - Added eStarGZ support for Studios with conda packages.
- **Platform**
  - Introduced multiple improvements to the **Usage Overview** to simplify compute usage tracking.
  - Added automatic memory tracking for billing to automatically capture actual memory usage for tasks without explicit memory limits, ensuring accurate consumption tracking.
- **Pipelines**
  - `retries` and `ignored` status task counts are now included in progress response when a workflow is finalized.
  - Improved loading time for pipeline details (up to 700ms improvement) for repositories like nf-core/rnaseq. This resolves timeout issues when launching pipelines.

 ## Bug fixes

- Fixed a missing newline in the `includeCustomUserConfig` method and resolved an issue where where custom config `includeConfig` statements were improperly concatenated, causing syntax errors when parsed.
