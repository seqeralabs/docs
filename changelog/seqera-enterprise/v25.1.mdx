# Seqera Enterprise v25.1 Release Notes

Seqera Platform Enterprise version 25.1 introduces Studios GA and a number of bug fixes and performance enhancements.

Studios is Seqera's in-platform tool for secure, on-demand, interactive data analysis using containers created from Seqera-managed container template images or your own organization-managed custom environments. You only pay for the compute your Studio sessions consume, and the compute is adjacent to your data, significantly reducing data transfer costs and wasted time copying data from storage to analysis. This significantly reduces infrastructure management requirements, removes data silos, adheres to strict in-platform role-based access control, and lowers your operational costs. [Learn more about Studios](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/latest/studios).

## New features and improvements

### Studios

- **Labeled templates**: Labels indicate the status of support (`recommended` or `deprecated`) for a Seqera-managed Studio container template version. Users can migrate a Studio to a new base container template when **Adding as new**.
- **[Private sessions](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/latest/studios/managing#general-config)**: When adding a new Studio, the number of concurrent connections (private vs. all workspace members) can now be defined in **General Config > Collaboration**.
- **[Custom session lifespans](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-enterprise/latest/studios/managing#modify-session-lifespan-for-all-studios)**: This new feature allows you to set a maximum lifespan for a session, after which time the session is stopped automatically and a checkpoint created, or the session can be extended on-demand.
- **Resource labels**: Users with at least workspace maintainer role permissions can manage the resource labels inherited from the compute environment and attached to the Studio. Resource labels attached to each Studio don't affect the default resource labels associated with the compute environment.

### Fusion

- AWS Batch compute environments default to Amazon Linux 2023 AMI when Fusion v2 is enabled.
- Add support for Fusion licensing.

### General

- Updated list of EC2 families with NVMe disks available.
- Audit log update: Pipeline edit events are now logged.
- Switch AWS Batch compute environment dependencies to AWS SDK v2.
- Switch Compute dependencies to AWS SDK v2.
- You can now upload custom icons when adding or updating a GitHub pipeline. If no user-uploaded icon is defined, the icon defined in the `manifest.icon` Nextflow config field is used by default. Otherwise, the GitHub organization avatar is used.
- New dynamic page title for easy bookmarking.
- Added `totalProcesses` to workflow progress responses.
- Implement collapsible view for JSON workflow parameters tab and add **View as YAML** option.
- Update the pipeline name regular expression to allow pipeline names containing dots ('.').
- Allow Nextflow configuration parameters with embedded references to other parameters to be shown verbatim.
- Improved error messaging when pipeline information can't be fetched indicates whether the issue is due to a missing resource, or failed authentication due to expired credentials.
- Azure jobs are now automatically terminated after all tasks are complete.
- Send only added/updated run parameters when launching a pipeline. This includes all defaults and parameters passed during the launch.
- Allow users to remove organization logos.
- New workflow job monitoring collects and publishes Platform metrics.
- Notify the user when secrets cleanup fails.
- Dashboard page: Add a date filter.
- Bump nf-launcher default to version 25.10.5.
- Upgrade to Angular 18.

## Bug fixes

### Studios

- Fixed resource labels being erroneously non-editable for the Maintain role when adding or starting a Studio session.
- Fixed searches for names containing special SQL wildcard characters (\_, %).

### General

- Prohibit duplicate Git credentials and tie-break on `lastUpdated` for existing duplicates. Preference is given to the last-updated credentials when there are multiple candidates. A check is also added to avoid duplicates when creating new credentials.
- Set `ECS_CONTAINER_START_TIMEOUT` to 10 minutes in the ECS settings used by AWS Batch CEs, to prevent `Task failed to start - DockerTimeoutError: Could not transition to started; timed out after waiting 3m0s` errors.
- Compute environment creation form allows pre- and post-run scripts to be longer than the accepted value of 1024 characters.
- Disable reset selection on data change in workflow list component.
- Take into account the alternative `mainScript` path.
- Use `preferred_username` as fallback email field for OIDC login.
- Drop the last characters in job definition names longer than the prescribed limit.
- Fixed an additional reference to the `mainScript` parameter in the `pipeline-info` API response.
- Fixed a problem with Entra and `javax.mail` transitive dependency.
- A change in the nf-core tools template made config profile search in the pipeline launch form inconsistent in Platform as it's prepended by a ternary operator. This release introduces a fix that improves config profile name parsing.
- Do not fetch info for `INVALID` status pipelines, fetch for all other statuses including `DISABLED`.
- Fallback to primary compute environment when launching a shared pipeline without an associated compute environment from a private workspace.
- Fixed regression of the quick launch form not selecting the primary compute environment by default.
