## Container registry credentials

From version 22.3, Tower supports the configuration of credentials for the Nextflow Wave container service to authenticate to private and public container registries. For more information on Wave containers, see [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/wave.html).

:::note
Container registry credentials are only leveraged by the Wave containers service. In order for your pipeline execution to leverage Wave containers, add `wave { enabled=true }` either to the **Nextflow config** field on the launch page, or to your nextflow.config file.

### AWS ECR access

Wave requires programmatic access to your private registry via [long-term access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#create-long-term-access-keys). Create a user with registry read permissions (e.g. a subset of the AWS-managed `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` policy) for this purpose.

An IAM administrator can create and manage access keys from the AWS management console:

1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. Select **Users** from the navigation pane.
3. Select the name of the user whose keys you want to manage, then select the **Security credentials** tab. We recommend creating an IAM user specifically for Wave authentication instead of using existing credentials with broader permissions.
4. In the **Access keys** section, select **Create access key**. Each IAM user can have only two access keys at a time, so if the Create option is deactivated, delete an existing access key first.
5. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives** page, select **Other** and then **Next**.
6. On the **Retrieve access key** page, you can either **Show** the user's secret access key details, or store them by selecting **Download .csv file**.
7. The newly created access key pair is active by default and can be stored as a container registry credential in Tower.

:::note
Your credential must be stored in Tower as a **container registry** credential, even if the same access keys already exist in Tower as a workspace credential.

### Add credentials to Tower

- From an organization workspace: navigate to the Credentials tab and select **Add Credentials**.

- From your personal workspace: select **Your credentials** from the user top-right menu, then select **Add credentials**.
