Tower is available in three versions:

- **Tower Cloud**: The hosted version of Tower is available free of charge at [tower.nf](https://tower.nf). This version is for individuals and organizations that want to get set up fast. It is the recommended way for users to become familiar with Tower. The service is hosted by Seqera Labs.

- **Tower Community**: The Community edition of Tower is open-source and can be deployed by anyone on their own infrastructure. The community edition has basic features for the monitoring of pipelines by an individual user.

- **Tower Enterprise**: The Enterprise edition of Tower contains the latest features and can be deployed in an organization's own cloud or on-premises infrastructure. This option includes dedicated support from Seqera Labs and is recommended for production environments.
