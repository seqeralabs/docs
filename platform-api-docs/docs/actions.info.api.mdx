[Actions](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/pipeline-actions/overview) enable event-based pipeline execution, such as triggering a pipeline launch with a GitHub webhook whenever the pipeline repository is updated. Seqera Platform currently offers support for native GitHub webhooks and a general Tower webhook that can be invoked programmatically.
