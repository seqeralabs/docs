Labels endpoints in the Seqera Platform API are used to manage both labels and resource labels. 

[Labels](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/labels/overview) are workspace-specific free-text annotations that can be applied to pipelines, actions, or workflow runs, either during or after creation. Use labels to organize your work and filter key information.

[Resource labels](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/resource-labels/overview) provide a flexible tagging system for annotation and tracking of the cloud services consumed by a run. Resource labels are sent to the service provider for each cloud compute environment in `key=value` format.
