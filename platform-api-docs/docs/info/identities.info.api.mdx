[Managed identities](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/credentials/managed_identities) offer significant advantages for high performance computing (HPC) environments by enabling granular access control for individual workspace users. Unlike traditional SSH credentials that grant all workspace users access to HPC clusters using the same set of credentials, managed identities ensure each userâ€™s activity is logged under their own credentials.
