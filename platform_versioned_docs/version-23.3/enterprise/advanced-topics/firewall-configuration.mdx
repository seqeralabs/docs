Seqera Platform Cloud ([tower.nf](https://tower.nf)) may need to connect to resources within your network, e.g., your storage server.
To do so, your firewall must be configured to allow certain IPs to reach your resources.

A dynamic list of IPs is kept up-to-date at https://meta.seqera.io/v1/.

This endpoint returns a JSON object that can be parsed to dynamically adapt your firewall, e.g., in Python with the `requests` package:

```python
$ python3
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get("https://meta.seqera.io/v1/").json()
{'tower.nf': ['18.171.4.252/32', '18.135.7.45/32', '18.169.21.18/32']}
```
