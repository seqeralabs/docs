As a root user, you can access a comprehensive overview of the organizations, workspaces, users, and teams in your Seqera account from the **Admin panel**. It also includes tabs for application event [audit logs](../monitoring/audit-logs.mdx), administrative statistics, and system configuration options.

The **Admin panel** menu is accessible in the user menu if you're logged in as a root user. This role should only be assigned to a system administrator as it provides high-level visibility and configuration access to your account.

:::tip
See [Basic configuration](../enterprise/configuration/overview.mdx#basic-configuration) to learn how to add root users to your account with the `TOWER_ROOT_USERS` environment variable.

## Organization administration

The **Organization administration** tab lists all the organizations in your account.

#### Search organizations

You can use the search function to find a specific organization by its name or email, as well as perform various operations with that organization.

#### Create an organization

Select **Add organization** to create a new organization from scratch.

#### Edit an organization

Select an organization name from the table to edit or delete it.

:::note
From version 23.2, organization owners and root users can edit organization names on the **Edit organization** page.

#### Membership administration

**Available from version 22.3.x**

Select **Manage users** to access the **Membership administration** page, where you can view all the memberships for the selected organization from the organizations list. You can also list and search for all users that are members or owners of the selected organization, change a user's role, remove a member from the organization, or add a new user to the organization.

**Note:** You can only add existing users to an organization. You can't remove a membership if the user being removed is the last owner of the selected organization until you promote another user to **Owner** before removing or demoting the last owner.

## Workspace administration

The **Workspaces** tab lists all the workspaces in your account. If a user is concurrently assigned to a workspace as both a named _participant_ and member of a _team_, Seqera assigns the higher of the two privilege sets.

Example:

- If the participant role is Launch and the team role is Admin, the user will have Admin rights.
- If the participant role is Admin and the team role is Launch, the user will have Admin rights.
- If the participant role is Launch and the team role is Launch, the user will have Launch rights.

As a best practice, use teams as the primary vehicle for assigning rights within a workspace and only add named participants when one-off privilege escalations are deemed necessary.

#### Search workspaces

You can use the search function to find a specific workspace by name to view and edit that workspace.

#### Create a workspace

Select **Add workspace** to create a new workspace. Choose a workspace name that isn't already in use - if the new workspace name already exists in the system, the creation will fail. Once the new workspace has been created, it's listed in the **Workspaces** tab list.

#### Edit a workspace
