Each user has a unique **user workspace** to manage resources such as pipelines, compute environments, and credentials. You can also create multiple workspaces within an organization context and associate each of these workspaces with dedicated teams of users, while providing fine-grained access control for each of the teams.

**Organization workspaces** extend the functionality of user workspaces by adding the ability to fine-tune access levels for specific members, collaborators, or teams. This is achieved by managing **participants** in the organization workspaces.

Organizations consist of members, while workspaces consist of participants.

:::note
A workspace participant may be a member of the workspace organization or a collaborator within that workspace only. Collaborators count toward the total number of workspace participants. See [Usage limits](../limits/limits.mdx).

## Create a new workspace

Organization owners and admins can create a new workspace within an organization:

1.  Go to the **Workspaces** tab of the organization page.
1.  Select **Add Workspace**.
1.  Enter the **Name** and **Full name** for the workspace.
1.  Optionally, add a **Description** for the workspace.
1.  Under **Visibility**, select either **Private** or **Shared**. Private visibility means that workspace pipelines are only accessible to workspace participants.
1.  Select **Add**.

:::tip
As a workspace owner, you can modify optional workspace fields after workspace creation. You can either select **Edit** on an organization's workspaces list or the **Settings** tab within the workspace page.
:::

Apart from the **Participants** tab, the _organization_ workspace is similar to the _user_ workspace. As such, the relation to [runs](../launch/launchpad.mdx), [actions](../pipeline-actions/overview.mdx), [compute environments](../compute-envs/overview.mdx), and [credentials](../credentials/overview.mdx) is the same.

## Edit a workspace

:::note
From version 23.2, **workspace owners** can edit their workspace name, either from the workspace settings tab or the [Admin panel](../administration/overview.mdx).
:::

Open the **Settings** tab on the workspace page and select **Edit Workspace**. Make your updates and select **Update** to save changes.

## Add a new participant

A new workspace participant can be an existing organization member, team, or collaborator. To add a new participant to a workspace:

1.  Go to the **Participants** tab in the workspace menu.
1.  Select **Add participant**.
1.  Enter the **Name** of the new participant.
1.  Optionally, update the participant **role**.

## Participant roles

Organization owners can assign role-based access levels to any **participant** in an organization workspace.

:::tip
You can group **members** and **collaborators** into **teams** and apply a role to that team. Members and collaborators inherit the access role of the team.
:::

You can apply one of the following roles to workspace participants:

1.  **Owner**: The participant has full permissions for all resources within the workspace, including the workspace settings.
1.  **Admin**: The participant has full permissions for resources associated with the workspace and access to all the actions associated with all roles, including all data-related roles. They can can create, modify, and delete pipelines, compute environments, actions, credentials, and secrets. They can also add/remove users in the workspace and edit the workspace settings. A participant with this role cannot delete a workspace.
1.  **Maintain**: The participant can launch pipelines and modify pipeline executions (e.g., change the pipeline launch compute environment, parameters, pre/post-run scripts, Nextflow config), create new pipeline configurations in the Launchpad, and add secrets. They can upload, download, and preview data in Data Explorer, hide/unhide buckets, manage buckets, and manage the metadata associated with buckets. They can also add, update, and delete a data studio session. This includes starting, stopping, and changing the configuration. A participant with this role cannot modify compute environment settings and credentials.
1.  **Launch**: The participant can launch pipelines and modify the pipeline input/output parameters in the Launchpad. This includes starting, stopping, and changing the configuration. They cannot modify the launch configuration or other resources. They can list, search and view the status, configuration, and details of data studio sessions and connect to a running data studio session.
1.  **Connect**: The participant can list, search, and view the status, configuration, and details of data studios sessions. They cannot add, update (start/stop/change config) or delete data studios sessions. They can also connect to a running data studio session and interact with the contents, and access team resources in read-only mode. They cannot launch or maintain pipelines. A participant with this role also cannot manage any data in Data Explorer — uploading, downloading, or previewing data, hiding/unhiding, managing buckets, or managing the metadata associated with buckets.
1.  **View**: The participant can only access team resources in read-only mode. This includes the ability to list, search, and view the status, configuration, and details of mounted data in Data Explorer and data studio sessions.

## Workspace run monitoring

To allow users executing pipelines from the command line to share their runs with a given workspace, see [deployment options](../getting-started/deployment-options.mdx#nextflow--with-tower).
