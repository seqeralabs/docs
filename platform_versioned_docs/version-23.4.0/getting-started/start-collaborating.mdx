Before you get started with Seqera Platform, you must set up an organization. You can then add members, create teams, and invite external peers for collaboration within your organization.

## Organizations

Organizations are the top-level structure and contain workspaces, members, and teams. You can also add external collaborators to an organization. See [Organizations](../orgs-and-teams/organizations.mdx).

## User workspaces

Each user has a unique personal workspace to manage resources such as pipelines, compute environments, and credentials. See [Workspace management](../orgs-and-teams/workspace-management.mdx). 

## Organization workspaces

You can create multiple workspaces within an organization context and associate each of these workspaces with dedicated teams of users, providing fine-grained access control for each team. See [Workspace management](../orgs-and-teams/workspace-management.mdx).
