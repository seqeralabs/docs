Seqera Platform Cloud ([tower.nf](https://tower.nf)) may need to connect to resources within your network, e.g., your storage server. To do so, your firewall must be configured to allow certain IPs to reach your resources.

A dynamic list of IPs is kept up-to-date at https://meta.seqera.io/v1/.

This endpoint returns a JSON object that can be parsed to dynamically adapt your firewall, e.g., in Python with the `requests` package:

```python
$ python3
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get("https://meta.seqera.io/v1/").json()
{'tower.nf': ['18.171.4.252/32', '18.135.7.45/32', '18.169.21.18/32']}
```

### DNS allowlist

In order for you to access resources such as Fusion tarballs, `nf-xpack` files, Wave cloud containers and other services, you'll need to add `*.seqera.io.cdn.cloudflare.net` to the allowlist in your network firewall. If DNS wildcards aren't supported by your firewall, you can use the following:

- `fusionfs.seqera.io.cdn.cloudflare.net`
- `nf-xpack.seqera.io.cdn.cloudflare.net`
- `wave-cache-prod-cloudflare.seqera.io.cdn.cloudflare.net`

If you chose to filter by specific DNS records, please note that new services may be added in the future.

:::note
If your allowlist is based on IP addresses, allow all of the following IP addresses: https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/.
