This page describes the infrastructure and other prerequisites for deploying Seqera Platform Enterprise on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Prerequisites

You can run the Seqera container with [Docker](../docker-compose.mdx) on an AWS EC2 instance, or with [Kubernetes](../kubernetes.mdx) on an Amazon EKS cluster. Ensure that you satisfy the requirements for your installation target. Refer to this list of shared and target-specific prerequisites:

- **SMTP server**: If you don't have an email server, you can use [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).

Amazon [blocks EC2 traffic over port 25 by default](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-port-25-throttle/). Ensure that your integration uses a port that can successfully reach your SMTP server.

- **MySQL database**: An external database, such as one provided by [Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), is highly recommended for production deployments.

If you decide to use an external database, you must create a MySQL user and database manually. See [Configuration](../configuration/overview.mdx#seqera-and-redis-databases) for more details.

- **(Optional) SSL certificate**: HTTP must not be used in production environments so an SSL certificate is required for your Seqera instance to handle HTTPS traffic.

  If you don't have a pre-existing SSL certificate, you can [request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs.html) or [import](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html) an SSL certificate into the [Amazon Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) (ACM).

**From version 22.1.1, HTTP-only implementations **must** set the `TOWER_ENABLE_UNSAFE_MODE=true` environment variable in the Seqera hosting infrastructure to enable user login. HTTP must not be used in production environments.**

- **(Optional) DNS**: DNS is required to support human-readable domain names and load-balanced traffic.

If you don't have access to a pre-existing DNS service, you can use [Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html).

- **(Optional) S3 bucket for Application Load Balancer (ALB) logs**: ALB logs can be stored in an S3 bucket.

If you don't have a pre-configured S3 Bucket for ALB access log storage, you'll need to [specify and configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html) a target bucket.

### Prerequisites for Docker

An [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance is required. See the [detailed instructions](#aws-setup) to provision an EC2 instance for this purpose.

### Prerequisites for EKS

If you're installing Seqera Enterprise with Kubernetes, an [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html) cluster is required. See the [EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to provision your own cluster. Your EKS cluster must satisfy the following requirements:

- Kubernetes 1.19 or later
- **Subnet requirements**

  - At least 2 subnets across two different Availability Zones
  - Subnets must be tagged for [AWS Load Balancer Controller auto-discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html)
  - Public subnets must be configured to [auto-assign IPs on launch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/upcoming-changes-to-ip-assignment-for-eks-managed-node-groups/)
  - Public and private subnets must allow egress traffic to the public internet

- **RBAC requirements**

  - The cluster must be created by a non-root user
  - `aws-auth` must be updated to [allow access to additional IAM users/roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html) (if needed)

- **Addons**
  - Install the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/)
  - Install the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)

**The ingress that we provide for EKS assumes that your cluster supports:**

1.  ALB provisioning via the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)
1.  ALB integration with the [Amazon Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)

Additionally, the ingress assumes the presence of SSL certificates, DNS resolution, and ALB logging. If you've chosen not to use some or all of these features, you'll need to modify the manifest accordingly before applying it to the cluster.

### Seqera container images

Seqera Platform Enterprise is distributed as a collection of Docker containers available through the Seqera
container registry ([cr.seqera.io](https://cr.seqera.io)). Contact [support](https://support.seqera.io) to get your container access credentials. Once you've received your credentials, retrieve the Seqera container images:

1.  Retrieve the **username** and **password** you received from Seqera support.

1.  Run the following Docker command to authenticate to the registry (using the `username` and `password` values copied in step 1):

   ```bash
   docker login -u '/\<USERNAME\>/' -p '/\PASSWORD\>/' cr.seqera.io
   ```

1.  Pull the Seqera container images with the following commands:

   ```bash
   docker pull cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v23.4.3

   docker pull cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v23.4.3
   ```

**`cr.seqera.io` is the default Seqera container image registry from version 22.4. Use of the AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud image registries in existing installations is still supported but is deprecated for **new installations** from June 2023. See [here](../advanced-topics/seqera-container-images.mdx) for steps to use the Seqera private AWS Elastic Container Registry.**

## AWS setup

This section provides step-by-step instructions for some commonly used AWS services for Seqera deployment. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) for up-to-date instructions, and contact [AWS support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) if you have any issues with provisioning AWS resources.

### Fetch Seqera config values from AWS Parameter Store

From version 23.1, you can retrieve Seqera Enterprise configuration values remotely from the AWS Parameter Store:

1.  Configure [AWS authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html) to grant AWS Parameter Store access on your local host.
1.  Retrieve the Seqera container images and install the application using the instructions at the top of this page.
1.  The default value for `tower.application.name` is `tower-app`. This can be changed in your `tower.yml` configuration file. Note that your application name must be specified in the path to your configuration values in AWS Parameter Store (see step 5 below).
1.  Set the `TOWER_ENABLE_AWS_SSM` environment variable to `true`.
1.  Add configuration parameters to the AWS Parameter Store individually, using the format `/config/<application_name>/<cfg_path> : <cfg_value>`. For example:

   ```bash
   /config/tower-app/tower.logger.levels.com.amazonaws : "WARN"
   ```

1.  Start or restart your Seqera instance to confirm that the configuration value is fetched. The following entries should appear in your backend log:

   ```bash
   [main] - INFO  i.m.context.DefaultBeanContext - Reading bootstrap environment configuration
   [main] - INFO  i.m.d.c.c.DistributedPropertySourceLocator - Resolved 2 configuration sources from client: compositeConfigurationClient(AWS Parameter Store)
   ```

### Amazon SES

:::caution
If you use Simple Email Service in sandbox mode, both the _sender_ and the _receiver_ email addresses must be verified via AWS SES. Sandbox is not recommended for production use. See the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html) for instructions to move out of the sandbox.
:::

1.  Go to the [**Amazon Simple Email Service**](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ses) console.

1.  In the navigation menu, select **SMTP Settings**.

1.  Select **Create my SMTP Credentials**

1.  Select **Create**.

1.  Select **Show User SMTP Credentials** to copy your credentials, or select **Download Credentials**.

**The credentials (username and password) will not be shown to you again after this instance.**

1.  You will be automatically redirected to the IAM dashboard. Log back in to the [Amazon SES Console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ses).

1.  Select **Email Addresses** in the navigation menu. Then, select **Verify a new Email Address**.

1.  A pop-up asking for your email should automatically appear. Once you type in your email address and select **Verify This Email Address**, you should receive a confirmation email from Amazon SES to confirm email address ownership.

1.  Open the verification link in the message.

**The verification link is **only valid for 24 hours** after your original request for verification.**

You can now use Amazon SES to send email from this address.

**To avoid emails sent from SES being flagged as spam, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ses-email-flagged-as-spam/).**

See the AWS documentation for more options, such as setting up an [Easy DKIM for a Domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-authentication-dkim-easy-setup-domain.html) or [Authentication Email with SPF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-authentication-spf.html).

### Amazon RDS

1.  Open the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).

1.  Select **Create database > Standard create > MySQL**.

1.  Under **Edition**, select **MySQL Community** and any version under **5.7.x**, or **8.0.x**.

1.  Enter the **DB cluster identifier** (e.g., `tower-db`).

1.  Enter the **Master username**, or keep the default.

1.  Enter the **Master password**.

   - To use an automatically generated master password, select **Auto generate a password**.
   - To use a custom master password, deselect **Auto generate a password** and enter your password in **Master password** and **Confirm password**.

1.  Under **Instance configuration**, select the **DB instance class** and instance type.

1.  Under **Connectivity**, select the correct **VPC security group**. Confirm this with your AWS administrator.

1.  Under **Additional configuration**, enter the **Initial database name** (e.g., `tower`).

1.  Select **Create database**.

After your database is created:

1.  Update the inbound rules for the underlying EC2 instance to allow MySQL connections.

1.  Update `TOWER_DB_URL` in your configuration value with the database hostname.

### Amazon EC2

If you've never set up an Amazon EC2 instance for Linux, see [this guide](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/) to get started.

1.  Open the [AWS Management console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home).

1.  Log in as an IAM user with your credentials.

1.  Under **AWS services**, select **All Services**.

1.  Under **Compute**, select **EC2**.

1.  Select **Instances**, then **Launch instances**.

1.  You will be asked to choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Scroll to the middle of the page and select **Amazon Linux 2**.

1.  Once you choose **Select**, you'll be redirected to **Step 2: Choose an Instance Type**.

1.  Scroll down and select either **c5a.xlarge** or **c5.large** — these provide 4 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.

1.  Select **Next: Configure Instance Details**.

1.  If required, configure the instance details settings. Then, select **Next: Add Storage**.

1.  The root storage should be 20GB. Configure this under **Size (GiB)**.

1.  Select **Add Tags** (if required) to add case-sensitive key-value pairs (e.g., `key = Name` and `value = Webserver`).

1.  Select **Next: Configure Security Group**.

1.  Enter `tower-sg` as the Security Group name.

1.  Optionally, you can enter a description for your Security Group's name.

1.  Configure the type of protocol settings. Note that the security group port must be configured to 8000.

1.  Select **Review and Launch**.

1.  Once you have reviewed your instance, select **Launch**.

1.  Select an existing key pair or create a new one in the pop-up that appears.

    If you already have an existing key pair, select **Choose an existing key pair** and choose from the available options in the drop-down menu.

    If you don't have a key pair yet, select **Create a new keypair**. Enter a name, then select **Download Key Pair**.

    **Note:** Once you download the key pair, store it in a secure and accessible location. You won't be able to download the file again after it is created.

1.  Select **Launch Instances**.

1.  Use the key pair to connect to the server using SSH and its public IP address. Terminal-based SSH is easier to use than browser-based SSH for copying and pasting text.

1.  Install Docker by following the [Installing Docker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-docker.html#install-docker-instructions) instructions for Linux.

1.  Install Docker Compose by following the [manual installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually).

1.  Confirm that Docker Compose is installed:

    ```bash
    docker compose version
    Docker Compose version v2.24.1
    ```

1.  Configure AWS CLI and retrieve the [Seqera container images](#seqera-container-images). AWS CLI v2 is pre-installed in Amazon Linux.
