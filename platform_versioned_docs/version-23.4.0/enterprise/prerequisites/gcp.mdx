This page describes the infrastructure and other prerequisites for deploying Seqera Platform Enterprise on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Prerequisites

You can run the Seqera container with [Docker](../docker-compose.mdx) on an GCP VM instance or with [Kubernetes](../kubernetes.mdx) on a Google GKE cluster. Ensure that you satisfy the requirements for your installation target. Refer to this list of shared and target-specific prerequisites:

- **SMTP server**: If you don't have an email server, Google Cloud provides several ways to [send emails](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/sending-mail):

  - Google Workspace:

    - [WorkSpace SMTP Relay](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2956491?hl=en)

  - Third-party services from the Google Cloud marketplace, including:

    - [SendGrid](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/sending-mail/using-sendgrid)
    - [Mailgun](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/sending-mail/using-mailgun)
    - [Mailjet](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/sending-mail/using-mailjet)

  Work with your IT team to select the best solution for your organization.

- **MySQL database**: An external database (i.e., external to your Docker Compose or Kubernetes deployment) is highly recommended for production deployments. If you don't have your own database service, you can use [Google CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/quickstart).

  If you decide to use an external database, you must create a MySQL user and database manually. See [Configuration](../configuration/overview.mdx#seqera-and-redis-databases) for more details.

- **(Optional) SSL certificate**: An SSL certificate is required for your Seqera instance to handle HTTPS traffic.

:::caution
From version 22.1.1, HTTP-only implementations **must** set the `TOWER_ENABLE_UNSAFE_MODE=true` environment variable in the Seqera hosting infrastructure to enable user login. HTTP must not be used in production environments.
:::

- **(Optional) Public IP address**: A public IP address can be reserved for the Seqera ingress to keep the IP address constant across restarts. If you don't reserve an IP address, the ingress will create one for you automatically, but it will be different every time you deploy the ingress. Reserve a public IP address with the following steps:

  1. Got to **VPC network > External IP addresses** and select **Reserve Static Address**.

  2. Assign a name (e.g., `tower-ip`). This name will be used later to configure the ingress.

  3. Select the region where your GKE cluster is deployed.

  4. Select **Reserve**.

### Prerequisites for Docker

A [Google Compute Engine (GCE)](https://cloud.google.com/compute) instance is required to deploy Seqera Enterprise via Docker Compose. See the [detailed instructions](#gcp-setup) to provision a VM instance for this purpose.

### Prerequisites for GKE

A [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) cluster is required to deploy Seqera Enterprise via Kubernetes. See the [GKE documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs) to provision your own cluster.

:::note
Seqera doesn't currently support GKE Autopilot due to a privilege issue with the Redis deployment. However, you can achieve most of the same behavior with a Standard cluster by enabling autoscaling and node auto-provisioning.

### Seqera container images

Seqera Platform Enterprise is distributed as a collection of Docker containers available through the Seqera
container registry [`cr.seqera.io`](https://cr.seqera.io). Contact [support](https://support.seqera.io) to get your container access credentials. Once you've received your credentials, retrieve the Seqera container images:

1. Retrieve the **username** and **password** you received from Seqera support.

2. Run the following Docker command to authenticate to the registry (using the `username` and `password` values copied in step 1):

   ```bash
   docker login -u '/\<USERNAME\>/' -p '/\PASSWORD\>/' cr.seqera.io
   ```

3. Pull the Seqera container images with the following commands:

   ```bash
   docker pull cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v23.4.3

   docker pull cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v23.4.3
   ```

:::caution
`cr.seqera.io` is the default Seqera container image registry from version 22.4. Use of the AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud image registries in existing installations is still supported but is deprecated for **new installations** from June 2023. See [here](../advanced-topics/seqera-container-images.mdx) for steps to use the Seqera private GCP Artifact Registry.

## GCP setup

This section provides step-by-step instructions for some commonly used GCP services for Seqera deployment. See the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs) for up-to-date instructions and contact [GCP support](https://cloud.google.com/support-hub) if you have any issues with provisioning GCP resources.

### Google CloudSQL

1. Browse to **Cloud SQL** and select **Create Instance**.

2. Select **MySQL** (you may need to enable the API).

3. Change to **Single zone** availability, unless you require high availability.

4. Update the **Region** and **Zone** to match the location of your Seqera deployment.

5. Expand **Show configuration options** and update the **Machine type** and **Storage** settings. The recommended machine type and disk size depends on the number of parallel pipelines you expect to run. In this guide, we use the **Standard** machine type with **1 vCPU**, and **20 GB SSD** storage.

6. Expand **Connections**, disable **Public IP**, and enable **Private IP**.

7. Select the **Network** (usually **default**). You may need to set up a **Private services access connection** for this VPC if you have not done so already. Enable the API and select **Use an automatically allocated IP range**. Select **Continue**, then **Create Connection**.

8. Select **Create Instance**.

9. Once the database has been created, select the instance, then **Databases**. Create a new database named _tower_.

10. Note the Private IP address of the instance as it must be supplied to the `TOWER_DB_URL` environment variable.

### Google Compute Engine

1. From the Navigation menu of the Google Cloud console, select **Compute Engine** to create a new VM instance. Select the machine name, region/zone, and machine type. In this example we have used an `e2-standard-2` instance (2 vCPUs, 8 GB memory).

2. Enable HTTP traffic. By default, the frontend is exposed to port 8000, so you will need to add a firewall rule to the underlying VPC network to allow port 8000 (after VM creation).

3. Connect to the machine using SSH. If you run into issues with SSH, or would like to set up IAP SSH, refer to the documentation for [TCP forward to IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding).

4. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) by following the instructions for Debian GNU/Linux.

5. Confirm that Docker Compose is installed:

    ```bash
    docker compose version
    Docker Compose version v2.24.1
    ```

6.  Configure `gcloud` and retrieve the [Seqera container images](#seqera-container-images).
