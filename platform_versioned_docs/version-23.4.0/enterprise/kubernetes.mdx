This guide assumes that all prerequisites have been met. Visit the corresponding **Prerequisites** page for your infrastructure provider.

:::note
You may also use this guide for deployments to other cloud platforms. However, you must satisfy any prerequisites for those platforms. Use at your own risk.

## Deploy Seqera Platform Enterprise on Kubernetes

Complete the following procedures to install Seqera Enterprise on a Kubernetes cluster:

### Create a namespace

Create a namespace for the Seqera resources.

1. Create the namespace (e.g., `seqera-nf`):

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace seqera-nf
    ```

2. Switch to the namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=seqera-nf
    ```

### Configure container registry credentials

Seqera Platform Enterprise is distributed as a collection of Docker containers available through the Seqera container registry [`cr.seqera.io`](https://cr.seqera.io). Contact [support](https://support.seqera.io) to get your container access credentials. After you've received your credentials, grant your cluster access to the registry:

1. Retrieve the `name` and `secret` values from the JSON file that you received from Seqera support.

2. Create a [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-kubectl/) with the `name` and `secret` values retrieved in the previous step:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret docker-registry cr.seqera.io \
      --docker-server=cr.seqera.io \
      --docker-username='<YOUR NAME>' \
      --docker-password='<YOUR SECRET>'
    ```

    The credential `name` contains a dollar `$` character. To prevent the Linux shell from interpreting this value as an environment variable, you must wrap it in single quotes.

3. Configure the Seqera cron service and the application frontend and backend to use the secret created in the previous step (see [tower-cron.yml](./_templates/k8s/tower-cron.yml) and [tower-svc.yml](./_templates/k8s/tower-svc.yml)):

    ```yaml
    imagePullSecrets:
    - name: "cr.seqera.io"
    ```

    This parameter is already included in the templates linked above. If you use a name other than `cr.seqera.io` for the secret, update this value accordingly in the configuration files.

### Seqera ConfigMap

1. Download and configure a [ConfigMap](_templates/k8s/configmap.yml) as detailed on the [configuration](configuration/overview.mdx) page.

2. Deploy the ConfigMap to your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f configmap.yml
    ```

:::note
The `configmap.yml` manifest includes both the `tower.env` file and `tower.yml` file. These files are made available to the other containers through volume mounts.
:::

### Redis

Seqera Enterprise requires a Redis database for caching purposes. Configure Redis manually by deploying a manifest to your cluster, or configure a managed Redis service.

**Deploy a Redis manifest to your cluster**

1. Download the appropriate manifest for your infrastructure:

    - [Azure AKS](_templates/k8s/redis.aks.yml)

    - [Amazon EKS](_templates/k8s/redis.eks.yml)

    - [Google Kubernetes Engine](_templates/k8s/redis.gke.yml)

2. Deploy to your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f redis.*.yml
    ```

**Managed Redis services**

Seqera supports managed Redis services such as [Amazon ElastiCache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/WhatIs.html), [Azure Cache for Redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview), or [Google Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis).

When using a managed Redis service, you must specify the service IP address or DNS name for the `TOWER_REDIS_URL` as described in the following sections.

**AWS ElastiCache requirements**

- Use a single-node cluster, as multi-node clusters are not supported
- Use an instance with at least 6GB capacity ([cache.m4.large](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/CacheNodes.SupportedTypes.html) or greater)
- Specify your private ElastiCache instance in the Seqera environment variables:

  ```bash
  TOWER_REDIS_URL=redis://<redis private IP>:6379
  ```

**Azure Cache for Redis requirements**

- Use a single-node cluster, as multi-node clusters are not supported
- Use an instance with at least 6GB capacity ([C3](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/cache/) or greater)
- Specify your private Azure Cache for Redis instance in the Seqera environment variables:

  ```bash
  TOWER_REDIS_URL=redis://<redis private IP>:6379
  ```

**Google Memorystore requirements**

- Use a single-node cluster, as multi-node clusters are not supported
- Use an instance with at least 6GB capacity ([M2](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/pricing#instance_pricing) or greater)
- Specify your private Memorystore instance in the Seqera environment variables:

  ```bash
  TOWER_REDIS_URL=redis://<redis private IP>:6379
  ```

**Self-hosted Redis service**

If you run the Redis service as a container as part of your Docker or Kubernetes installation, you must specify the service name as part of the `TOWER_REDIS_URL`:

  ```bash
  TOWER_REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
  ```

### Seqera cron service

1. Download the [cron service manifest](_templates/k8s/tower-cron.yml) file.

2. Deploy the manifest to your cluster:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f tower-cron.yml
  ```

:::caution
This container creates the required database schema the first time it instantiates. This process can take a few minutes to complete and must finish before you instantiate the Seqera backend. Ensure this container is in the `READY` state before proceeding to the next step.
:::

### Seqera frontend and backend

1. Download the [manifest](_templates/k8s/tower-svc.yml).

2. Deploy the manifest to your cluster:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f tower-svc.yml
  ```

#### Seqera frontend unprivileged

An unprivileged version of the Seqera frontend image is also available. This image listens on an unprivileged port and therefore doesn't need to be run as the root user.

Replace the tag of the frontend image `cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v23.x.x` with `cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v23.x.x-unprivileged`. In the `frontend` service below, specify the `targetPort` to match the environment variable `NGINX_LISTEN_PORT` (see below):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: frontend
spec:
  ...
      containers:
        - name: frontend
          image: cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v23.4.3-unprivileged
          env:
            - name: NGINX_LISTEN_PORT  # If not defined, defaults to 8000.
              value: 8000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8000
```

The unprivileged Seqera image will soon deprecate the current image that requires root. The unprivileged image can be easily customized using environment variables:

- `NGINX_LISTEN_PORT` (default `8000`): The port the NGINX process will listen on
  inside the container. The `targetPort` on the `frontend` service must match the value
  defined in the environment variable.
- `NGINX_LISTEN_PORT_IPV6` (default `8000`): The NGINX listening port to open on the IPv6 address.
- `NGINX_UPSTREAM_HOST` (default `backend`): The hostname of the backend service to which the NGINX process will route requests.
- `NGINX_UPSTREAM_PORT` (default `8080`): The port where the backend service is exposed.

If further customization of the config file is needed, mount a config map/secret over the templated NGINX configuration file at `/etc/nginx/templates/tower.conf.template`. See [SSL/TLS](./configuration/ssl_tls.mdx##configure-seqera-to-present-a-ssltls-certificate) for an example.

### Seqera ingress

An ingress is used to make Seqera Enterprise publicly accessible, load-balance traffic, terminate TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting. The included ingress will create an external IP address and forward HTTP traffic to the Seqera frontend.

Download the appropriate manifest and configure it according to your infrastructure:

- [Azure AKS](_templates/k8s/ingress.aks.yml)

- [Amazon EKS](_templates/k8s/ingress.eks.yml)

- [Google Kubernetes Engine](_templates/k8s/ingress.gke.yml)

Deploy the manifest to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.*.yml
```

See the Kubernetes documentation on the [ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resource for more information. If you don't need to make Seqera externally accessible, you can also use a service resource to expose a [node port](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport) or a [load balancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) service to make it accessible within your intranet.

See the relevant documentation for configuring an ingress service on each cloud provider:

- [Amazon](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/guide/ingress/annotations/)
- [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-annotations)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress)

### Check status

Make sure that all services are up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## Test the application

To confirm that Seqera Enterprise is properly configured, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Seqera instance.

2. Create an **organization**.

3. Create a **workspace** within that organization.

4. Create a new **Compute environment**. See [Compute environments](../compute-envs/overview.mdx) for detailed instructions.

5. Select **Quick Launch** from the **Launchpad** tab in your workspace.

6. Enter the repository URL for the `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline (`https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq`).

7. In the **Config profiles** dropdown, select the `test` profile.

8. In **Pipeline parameters**, change the output directory to a location based on your compute environment:

    ```yaml
    # save to S3 bucket
    outdir: s3://<your-bucket>/results

    # save to scratch directory (Kubernetes)
    outdir: /scratch/results
    ```

9. Select **Launch**; you'll be redirected to the **Runs** tab for the workflow. After a few minutes, progress logs will be listed in that workflow's **Execution log** tab.

## Optional features

### Pipeline optimization

Seqera Platform offers a service that optimizes pipeline resource requests. Install the resource optimization service in your Kubernetes cluster with [this manifest](_templates/k8s/groundswell.yml).

Define a set of credentials for the resource optimization database in the `tower-groundswell-cfg` ConfigMap. This can be the same database used for Seqera, but in a different schema.

The initContainers will wait until both the Seqera and pipeline optimization service databases are ready before starting the migration in the Seqera database and finally starting the resource optimization container.

### Database console

The included [dbconsole.yml](_templates/k8s/dbconsole.yml) manifest can be used to deploy a simple web frontend to the Seqera database. Though not required, this can be useful for administrative purposes.

1. Deploy the database console:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f dbconsole.yml
  ```

2. Enable a port-forward for the database console to your local machine:

  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward deployment/dbconsole 8080:8080
  ```

3. Access the database console in a web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

### High availability

To configure Seqera Enterprise for high availability, note that:

- The `backend` service can be run in multiple replicas

- The `frontend` service is replicable, however in most scenarios it is not necessary

- The `cron` service may only have a single instance

- The `groundswell` service may only have a single instance
