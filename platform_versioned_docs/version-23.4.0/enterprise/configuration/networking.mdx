## HTTP proxy environment variables

:::caution
Proxies that require passwords aren't supported.
:::

If your Seqera Platform Enterprise instance must access the internet via a proxy server, configure the following case-insensitive environment variables:

- `http_proxy`: The proxy server for HTTP connections.
- `https_proxy`: The proxy server for HTTPS connections.
- `no_proxy`: One or more host names that bypass the proxy server.

In the following example, `alice.example.com:8080` is configured as a proxy for all HTTP and HTTPS traffic, except for traffic to the `internal.example.com` and `internal2.example.com` hosts.

```env
export http_proxy='alice.example.com:8080'
export https_proxy='alice.example.com:8080'
export no_proxy=internal.example.com,internal2.example.com
```

## Isolated environments

If you're deploying Seqera in an environment that has no external internet access, ensure that no pipeline assets or parameters in your configuration contain external links, as this will lead to connection failures.

## Mail proxy server

Mail proxy server configuration details must be set either in `tower.yml` or AWS Parameter Store.

**tower.yml**

::table{file=configtables/mail_server_proxy_yml.yml}

**AWS Parameter Store**

::table{file=configtables/mail_server_proxy_aws.yml}
