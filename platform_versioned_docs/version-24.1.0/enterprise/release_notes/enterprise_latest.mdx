# Release notes for Seqera Enterprise version 24.1.0

Seqera Platform Enterprise version 24.1.0 introduces three new features: Data Studios (in public preview), Data Explorer, and managed identities. A number of bug fixes and performance enhancements have also been included in this major release.

## Data Studios

[Data Studios](./data-studios.mdx) closes the loop from development to deployment and insights, allowing you to create, manage, and share notebook environments in Seqera with the click of a button. Data Studios also makes it seamless to work across teams with multi-user support, built-in authentication, and automatic snapshots as you work.

- Host a combination of container images and compute environments for interactive analysis using your preferred tools, like Jupyter notebooks, RStudio, and Visual Studio Code IDEs.
- Checkpoints provide a stable point-in-time snapshot.
- Collaborate and share data in real time.

Data Studios is available as a public preview. [Contact support](https://support.seqera.io) to request access to this feature. 

## Data Explorer

[Data Explorer](./data-explorer.mdx) allows you to browse and interact with remote data repositories from organization workspaces in Seqera Platform. It supports AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage repositories.

Data Explorer is now Generally Available and supports multi-file and multi-folder download. This allows users to download entire datasets of pipeline results to share with their team.

## Extended data roles

The **Connect** user role has been added to the existing user roles. [User roles](./roles.mdx) provide flexibility for admins to provide users with the permissions they need, without compromising security. Existing roles have been updated with functionality related to Data Studios:

- **Connect**: The ability to open a connection to a running session and interact with the contents.
- **Maintain**: The ability to create, update, start, stop, change configuration, and delete data studio sessions.
- **View**: The ability to list, search, and see the status/configuration/details of data studios.
- **Launch**: The ability to open a connection to a running session and interact with the contents.

See [User roles](../../orgs-and-teams/roles.mdx) for more information.

## Managed identities

Managed identities offer significant advantages for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments by enabling granular access control for individual workspace users. Unlike traditional SSH credentials that grant all workspace users access to HPC clusters with the same service account, managed identities ensure each user’s activity is logged under their own credentials.

See [Managed identities](../../credentials/managed_identities.mdx) for more information. 

## Other feature improvements

- Retrieve reports from primary compute environment on Nextflow CLI runs. See [Configure reports for Nextflow CLI runs](../../reports/overview.mdx#configure-reports-for-nextflow-cli-runs) for more information. 
- The standard email login can be disabled via `tower.yml` or an environment variable, provided an alternative OIDC provider is set up first. See, [Basic configuration](../configuration/overview.mdx#basic-configuration) for more information.

## Breaking changes

**MariaDB driver: New MySQL connection parameter required**

MariaDB driver 3.x requires a special parameter in the connection URL to connect to a MySQL database:

`jdbc:mysql://<domain>:<port>/tower?permitMysqlScheme=true`

All deployments using a MySQL database (regardless of version: 5.6, 5.7, or 8) should be updated accordingly when upgrading to Platform version 24.1.0 or later.

**MariaDB driver: No truncation support for MySQL 5.6**

The MariaDB driver has dropped support for the `jdbcCompliantTruncation` parameter, which was true by default and set the `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` SQL mode. The `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` mode produces an error when the value of a VARCHAR column exceeds its limit, instead of truncating it to fit. Most common installations of MySQL 5.7 and 8 already include this mode at the server level, but the Docker container version of MySQL 5.6 does not.

The SQL mode must be set explicitly through the connection URL for deployments still using MySQL 5.6:

`jdbc:mysql://<domain>:<port>/tower?permitMysqlScheme=true&sessionVariables=sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION'`

**Micronaut property key changes**

The property that determines the expiration time of the JWT access token (used for authenticating web sessions and Nextflow-Platform interactions) has changed:

| Previous                                                         | New                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `micronaut.security.token.jwt.generator.access-token.expiration` | `micronaut.security.token.generator.access-token.expiration` |
	
Enterprise deployments that have customized this value previously will need to adopt the new format.

## Upgrade steps

This version requires a database schema update. Make a backup of your Platform database prior to upgrade. 

:::caution
If you are upgrading from a version older than 23.4.1, update your installation to version [23.4.4](./23.4.mdx) first, before updating to 24.1.0 with the steps below.
:::

Docker Compose deployments require downtime while upgrading services. Restarting the application may take several minutes. See [Docker compose deployment](../docker-compose.mdx) for more information.

For Kubernetes deployments, apply the 24.1 `tower-cron.yml` to your cron pod and wait for the cron pod to be running before applying the `tower-svc.yml` to your backend pod and restarting the service. If the cron pod update is interrupted, you may need to restore the instance from your DB backup and start again. See [Kubernetes deployment](../kubernetes.mdx) for more information. 

For custom deployments with third-party services such as ArgoCD, [contact support](https://support.seqera.io) for assistance during upgrade. 

Follow these steps to update your DB instance and the Seqera installation:

:::caution
The database volume is persistent on the local machine by default if you use the `volumes` key in the `db` or `redis` section of your `docker-compose.yml` file to specify a local path to the DB or Redis instance. If your database is not persistent, you must back up your database before performing any application or database upgrades.
:::

1. Make a backup of the Seqera Platform database. If you use the pipeline optimization service and your `groundswell` database resides in a database instance separate from your Seqera database, make a backup of your `groundswell` database as well.
2. Download the 24.1 versions of your deployment templates and update your Seqera container versions:
    - [docker-compose.yml](../_templates/docker/docker-compose.yml) for Docker Compose deployments
    - [tower-cron.yml](../_templates/k8s/tower-cron.yml) and [tower-svc.yml](../_templates/k8s/tower-svc.yml) for Kubernetes deployments
3. Restart the application.
4. If you're using a containerized database as part of your implementation:
    1. Stop the application.
    2. Upgrade the MySQL image.
    3. Restart the application.
5. If you're using Amazon RDS or other managed database services:
    1. Stop the application.
    2. Upgrade your database instance.
    3. Restart the application.
6. If you're using the pipeline optimization service (`groundswell` database) in a database separate from your Seqera database, update the MySQL image for your `groundswell` database instance while the application is down (during step 4 or 5 above). If you're using the same database instance for both, the `groundswell` update will happen automatically during the Seqera database update.

**Custom deployment**:

- Run the `/migrate-db.sh` script provided in the `migrate-db` container. This will migrate the database schema.
- Deploy Seqera following your usual procedures.

## Nextflow launcher image

If you must host your nf-launcher container image on a private image registry, copy the [nf-launcher image](https://quay.io/seqeralabs/nf-launcher:j17-24.04.2) to your private registry. Then update your `tower.env` with the launch container environment variable:

    `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER=<FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_IMAGE>`

:::caution
If you're using AWS Batch, you will need to [configure a custom job definition](../advanced-topics/custom-launch-container.mdx) and populate the `TOWER_LAUNCH_CONTAINER` with the job definition name instead.
