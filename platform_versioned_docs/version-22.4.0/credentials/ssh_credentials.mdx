SSH public key authentication relies on asymmetric cryptography to generate a public and private key pair. The public key remains on the target (remote) machine, while the private key (and passphrase) is stored in Tower as a credential. The key pair is used to authenticate a Tower connection with your SSH-enabled environment.

:::note
All credentials are (AES-256) encrypted before secure storage and not exposed in an unencrypted way by any Tower API.

### Create an SSH key pair

To use SSH public key authentication:

- The remote system must have a version of SSH installed. This guide assumes the remote system uses OpenSSH. If you are using a different version of SSH, the key generation steps may differ.
- The SSH public key must be present on the remote system (usually in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).

To generate an SSH key pair:

1.  From the target machine, open a terminal and run `ssh-keygen`.
1.  Follow the prompts to:
   - specify a file path and name (or keep the default)
   - specify a passphrase (recommended)
1.  Navigate to the target folder (default `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa`) and open the private key file with a plain text editor.
1.  Copy the private key file contents before navigating to Tower.

### Create an SSH credential in Tower

- From an organization workspace: navigate to the Credentials tab and select **Add Credentials**.

- From your personal workspace: select **Your credentials** from the user top-right menu, then select **Add credentials**.

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Name            | A unique name for the credentials using alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores.                       | `my-ssh-creds`                                     |
| Provider        | Credential type                                                                                                | SSH                                                |
| SSH private key | The SSH private key file contents.                                                                             | `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----b3BlbnNza....` |
| Passphrase      | SSH private key passphrase (recommended). If your key pair was created without a passphrase, leave this blank. |                                                    |

Once the form is complete, select **Add**. The new credential is now listed under the **Credentials** tab.
