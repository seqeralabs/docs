## Overview

Pipeline actions allow launching of pipelines based on events.

Tower currently offers support for native **GitHub webhooks** and a general **Tower webhook** that can be invoked programmatically. Support for Bitbucket and GitLab are coming soon.

### GitHub webhooks

A **GitHub webhook** listens for any changes made in the pipeline repository. When a change occurs, Tower triggers the launch of the pipeline automatically.

To create a new **Pipeline action**, select the **Actions** tab and select **Add Action**.

1.  Enter a **Name** for your Action.

1.  Select **GitHub webhook** as the **Event source**.

1.  Select the **Compute environment** where the pipeline will be executed.

1.  Select the **Pipeline to launch** and (optionally) the **Revision number**.

1.  Enter the **Work directory**, the **Config profiles**, and the **Pipeline parameters**.

1.  Select **Add**.

The pipeline action is now setup. When a new commit occurs for the selected repository and revision, an event will be triggered in Tower and the pipeline will be launched.

### Tower launch hooks

A **Tower launch hook** creates a custom endpoint URL which can be used to trigger the execution of your pipeline programmatically from a script or web service.

To create a new **Pipeline action**, select the **Actions** tab and select **Add Action**.

1.  Enter a **Name** for your Action.

1.  Select **Tower launch hook** as the event source.

1.  Select the **Compute environment** to execute your pipeline.

1.  Enter the **Pipeline to launch** and (optionally) the **Revision number**.

1.  Enter the **Work directory**, the **Config profiles**, and the **Pipeline parameters**.

1.  Select **Add**.

The pipeline action has been created, and the new endpoint can be used to programmatically launch the corresponding pipeline. The snippet below shows an example `curl` command with the authentication token.

When you create a **Tower launch hook**, you also create an **access token** for launching pipelines through Tower. Access tokens can be managed on the [tokens page](https://tower.nf/tokens), which is also accessible from the navigation menu.
