`seqerakit` is a Python wrapper that allows you to set [Platform CLI](../cli/overview.mdx) command options with YAML configuration files. Individual seqerakit commands and configuration parameters can be chained together to automate the end-to-end creation of all Seqera Platform entities.

### Key features

As an extension of the Platform CLI, seqerakit enables:

- **Infrastructure as code**: Users manage and provision their infrastructure from the command line.
- **Simple configuration**: All Platform CLI command-line options can be defined in simple YAML format.
- **Automation**: End-to-end creation of Seqera Platform entities, from adding an organization to launching pipelines.

### Availability

seqerakit can be installed on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It is compatible with [Seqera Platform Cloud](https://cloud.seqera.io/) and Enterprise versions 21.08 and later.

See [Installation](./installation.mdx) to get started.
