You must provide a YAML file that defines the options for each of the entities you would like to create in Seqera Platform.

You will need to have an account on Seqera Platform (see [Plans and pricing](https://seqera.io/pricing/)). You will also need access to a Workspace and a pre-defined Compute Environment where you can launch a pipeline.

### Launch via YAML

1. Create a YAML file called `hello-world-config.yml` with the contents below, and customise the `<YOUR_WORKSPACE>` and `<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>` entries as required:

   ```yaml
   launch:
     - name: 'hello-world'                              # Workflow name
       workspace: '<YOUR_WORKSPACE>'                    # Workspace name
       compute-env: '<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>'        # Compute environment
       revision: 'master'                               # Pipeline revision
       pipeline: 'https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello' # Pipeline URL
   ```

2. Launch the pipeline with `seqerakit`:

   ```bash
   seqerakit hello-world-config.yml
   ```

3. Login to your Seqera Platform instance and check the Runs page in the appropriate Workspace for the pipeline you just launched!

### Launch via a Python script

You can also launch the same pipeline via a Python script. This will essentially allow you to extend the functionality on offer within the Seqera Platform CLI by leveraging the flexibility and customisation options available in Python.

1. Download the [`launch_hello_world.py`](./examples/python/launch_hello_world.py) Python script and customise the `<YOUR_WORKSPACE>` and `<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>` entries as required.

2. Launch the pipeline with `seqerakit`:

```bash
   python launch_hello_world.py
```

3. Login to your Seqera Platform instance and check the Runs page in the appropriate Workspace for the pipeline you just launched!
