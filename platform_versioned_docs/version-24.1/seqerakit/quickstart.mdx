You must provide a YAML file that defines the options for each of the entities you would like to create in Seqera Platform.

You will need a Seqera account (see [Plans and pricing](https://seqera.io/pricing/)). You will also need access to a workspace and a pre-defined compute environment where you can launch a pipeline.

### Launch via YAML

1. Create a YAML file called `hello-world-config.yml` with the contents below, and customize the `<YOUR_WORKSPACE>` and `<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>` entries as needed:

   ```yaml
   launch:
     - name: 'hello-world'                              # Workflow name
       workspace: '<YOUR_WORKSPACE>'                    # Workspace name
       compute-env: '<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>'        # Compute environment
       revision: 'master'                               # Pipeline revision
       pipeline: 'https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello' # Pipeline URL
   ```

2. Launch the pipeline with `seqerakit`:

   ```bash
   seqerakit hello-world-config.yml
   ```

3. Log in to your Seqera instance and check the **Runs** page in the appropriate workspace for the pipeline you just launched.

### Launch via a Python script

You can also launch the same pipeline via a Python script. This allows you to extend Platform CLI functionality by leveraging the flexibility and customization options available in Python.

1. Download the [`launch_hello_world.py`](./examples/python/launch_hello_world.py) Python script and customize the `<YOUR_WORKSPACE>` and `<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>` entries as needed.

2. Launch the pipeline with `seqerakit`:

```bash
   python launch_hello_world.py
```

3. Log in to your Seqera instance and check the **Runs** page in the appropriate workspace for the pipeline you just launched.
