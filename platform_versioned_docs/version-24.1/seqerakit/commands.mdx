Use the `--help` or `-h` parameter to list available commands and options:

```shell-session
seqerakit --help
```

### Input

Seqerakit supports input through paths to YAML configuration files or directly from standard input (stdin).

- Using file path:

    ```shell-session
    seqerakit /path/to/file.yaml
    ```

- Using stdin:

    ```shell-session
    cat /path/to/file.yaml | seqerakit -
    ```

See [Define your YAML file using CLI options](#define-your-yaml-file-using-cli-options) for guidance on formatting your input YAML files.

### Dryrun

Confirm that your configuration and command are correct before creating resources in your Seqera account, particularly when automating the end-to-end creation of multiple entities at once. To print the commands that would be executed with Platform CLI when using a YAML file, run your `seqerakit` command with the `--dryrun` flag:

```shell-session
seqerakit file.yaml --dryrun
```

### Specify targets

When using a YAML file as input that defines multiple resources, use the `--targets` flag to specify which resources to create. This flag accepts a comma-separated list of resource names. 

Supported resource names include:

- actions
- compute-envs
- credentials
- datasets
- labels
- launch
- members
- organizations
- participants
- pipelines
- secrets
- teams
- workspaces


For example, given a `test.yml` file that defines the following resources:

```yaml
workspaces:
  - name: 'workspace-1'
    organization: 'seqerakit'
...
compute-envs:
  - name: 'compute-env'
    type: 'aws-batch forge'
    workspace: 'seqerakit/workspace-1'
...
pipelines:
  - name: "hello-world"
    url: "https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello"
    workspace: 'seqerakit/workspace-1'
    compute-env: "compute-env"
...
```

You can target the creation of `pipelines` only by running:

```shell-session
seqerakit test.yml --targets pipelines
```

This will process only the pipelines block from the YAML file and ignore `workspaces` and `compute-envs`.

To create both workspaces and pipelines, run:

```shell-session
seqerakit test.yml --targets workspaces,pipelines
```

### Delete resources

Instead of adding or creating resources, specify the `--delete` flag to recursively delete resources in your YAML file:

```shell-session
seqerakit file.yml --delete
```

For example, if you have a `file.yml` that defines an organization, workspace, team, credentials, and compute environment that have already been created, run `seqerakit file.yml --delete` to recursively delete the same resources.

### Use `tw`-specific CLI options

Specify `tw`-specific CLI options with the `--cli=` flag:

```shell-session
seqerakit file.yaml --cli="--arg1 --arg2"
```

See [CLI commands](../cli/commands.mdx) or run `tw -h` for the full list of options.

:::note
The `--verbose` option for `tw` CLI is currently not supported in `seqerakit` commands.
:::

#### Example: HTTP-only connections

The Platform CLI expects to connect to a Seqera instance that is secured by a TLS certificate. If your Seqera Enterprise instance does not present a certificate, you must run your `tw` commands with the `--insecure` flag.

To use `tw`-specific CLI options such as `--insecure`, use the `--cli=` flag, followed by the options to use enclosed in double quotes:

```shell-session
seqerakit file.yaml --cli="--insecure"
```
