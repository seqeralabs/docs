Use the `--help` or `-h` parameter to list the available commands and their associated options:

```bash
seqerakit --help
```

### Input

`seqerakit` supports input through paths to YAML configuration foiels or directly from standard input (stdin).

- Using file path:

    ```bash
    seqerakit /path/to/file.yaml
    ```

- Using stdin:

    ```console
    $ cat file.yaml | seqerakit -
    ```

See [Defining your YAML file using CLI options](#defining-your-yaml-file-using-cli-options) for guidance on formatting your input YAML files.

### Dryrun

It is recommended to confirm that your configuration and command are correct before creating resources in your Platform account, particularly when automating end-to-end creation of multiple Platform entities at once. To print the commands that would be executed with Platform CLI when using a YAML file, run your command with the `--dryrun` flag:

```bash
seqerakit file.yaml --dryrun
```

### Delete resources

Instead of adding or creating resources, you can recursively delete resources in your YAML file by specifying the `--delete` flag:

```bash
seqerakit file.yaml --delete
```

For example, if you have a YAML file that defines an Organization -> Workspace -> Team -> Credentials -> Compute Environment that have already been created, with the `--delete` flag, `seqerakit` will recursively delete the Compute Environment -> Credentials -> Team -> Workspace -> Organization.

### Using `tw` specific CLI options

`tw` specific CLI options can be specified with the `--cli=` flag:

```bash
seqerakit file.yaml --cli="--arg1 --arg2"
```

See [CLI commands](../cli/commands.mdx) or run `tw -h` for the full list of options.

The Seqera Platform CLI expects to connect to a Seqera Platform instance that is secured by a TLS certificate. If your Seqera Platform Enterprise instance does not present a certificate, you will need to qualify and run your `tw` commands with the `--insecure` flag.

To use `tw` specific CLI options such as `--insecure`, use the `--cli=` flag, followed by the options you would like to use enclosed in double quotes.

For example:

```bash
seqerakit file.yaml --cli="--insecure"
```

For Seqera Platform Enterprise, to use an SSL certificate that is not accepted by the default Java certificate authorities and specify a custom `cacerts` store as accepted by the `tw` CLI, you can specify the `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/absolute/path/to/cacerts` option enclosed in double quotes to `seqerakit` as you would to `tw`, preceded by `--cli=`.

For example:

```bash
seqerakit hello-world-config.yml --cli="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/absolute/path/to/cacerts"
```

<b>Note</b>: Use of `--verbose` option for the `tw` CLI is currently not supported by `seqerakit`. Supplying `--cli="--verbose"` will raise an error.

## Specify targets
When using a YAML file as input that defines multiple resources, you can use the `--targets` flag to specify which resources to create. This flag takes a comma-separated list of resource names.

For example, given a YAML file that defines the following resources:

```yaml
workspaces:
  - name: 'showcase'
    organization: 'seqerakit_automation'
...
compute-envs:
  - name: 'compute-env'
    type: 'aws-batch forge'
    workspace: 'seqerakit/test'
...
pipelines:
  - name: "hello-world-test-seqerakit"
    url: "https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello"
    workspace: 'seqerakit/test'
    compute-env: "compute-env"
...
```

You can target the creation of `pipelines` only by running:

```bash
seqerakit test.yml --targets pipelines
```
This will process only the pipelines block from the YAML file and ignore other blocks such as `workspaces` and `compute-envs`.

### Multiple Targets
You can also specify multiple resources to create by separating them with commas. For example, to create both workspaces and pipelines, run:

```bash
seqerakit test.yml --targets workspaces,pipelines
```

## YAML Configuration Options

There are several options that can be provided in your YAML configuration file, that are handled specially by seqerakit and/or are not exposed as `tw` CLI options.

### 1. Pipeline parameters using `params` and `params-file`

To specify pipeline parameters, you may either use `params:` to specify a list of parameters, or use `params-file:` to point to a parameters file.

For example, to specify pipeline parameters within your YAML:

```yaml
params:
  outdir: 's3://path/to/outdir'
  fasta: 's3://path/to/reference.fasta'
```

Alternatively, to specify a file containing pipeline parameters:

```yaml
params-file: '/path/to/my/parameters.yaml'
```

Optionally, you may provide both:

```yaml
params-file: '/path/to/my/parameters.yaml'
params:
  outdir: 's3://path/to/outdir'
  fasta: 's3://path/to/reference.fasta'
```

**Note**: If duplicate parameters are provided, the parameters provided as key-value pairs inside the `params` nested dictionary of the YAML file will take precedence **over** values in the provided `params-file`.

### 2. `overwrite` Functionality
For every entity defined in your YAML file, you can specify `overwrite: True` to overwrite any existing entities in Seqera Platform of the same name.

`seqerakit` will first check to see if the name of the entity exists, if so, it will invoke a `tw <subcommand> delete` command before attempting to create it based on the options defined in the YAML file.

```console
DEBUG:root: Overwrite is set to 'True' for organizations

DEBUG:root: Running command: tw -o json organizations list
DEBUG:root: The attempted organizations resource already exists. Overwriting.

DEBUG:root: Running command: tw organizations delete --name $SEQERA_ORGANIZATION_NAME
DEBUG:root: Running command: tw organizations add --name $SEQERA_ORGANIZATION_NAME --full-name $SEQERA_ORGANIZATION_NAME --description 'Example of an organization'
```
### 3. Specifying JSON configuration files with `file-path`
The Seqera Platform CLI allows export and import of entities through JSON configuration files for pipelines and compute environments. To use these files to add a pipeline or compute environment to a workspace, use the `file-path` key to specify a path to a JSON configuration file.

An example of the `file-path` option is provided in the [compute-envs.yml](./templates/compute-envs.yml) template:

```yaml
compute-envs:
  - name: 'my_aws_compute_environment'                              # required
    workspace: 'my_organization/my_workspace'                       # required
    credentials: 'my_aws_credentials'                               # required
    wait: 'AVAILABLE'                                               # optional
    file-path: './compute-envs/my_aws_compute_environment.json'     # required
    overwrite: True
```


## Quick start

You must provide a YAML file that defines the options for each of the entities you would like to create in Seqera Platform.

You will need to have an account on Seqera Platform (see [Plans and pricing](https://seqera.io/pricing/)). You will also need access to a Workspace and a pre-defined Compute Environment where you can launch a pipeline.

### Launch via YAML

1. Create a YAML file called `hello-world-config.yml` with the contents below, and customise the `<YOUR_WORKSPACE>` and `<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>` entries as required:

   ```yaml # noqa
   launch:
     - name: 'hello-world'                              # Workflow name
       workspace: '<YOUR_WORKSPACE>'                    # Workspace name
       compute-env: '<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>'        # Compute environment
       revision: 'master'                               # Pipeline revision
       pipeline: 'https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello' # Pipeline URL
   ```

2. Launch the pipeline with `seqerakit`:

   ```bash
   seqerakit hello-world-config.yml
   ```

3. Login to your Seqera Platform instance and check the Runs page in the appropriate Workspace for the pipeline you just launched!

### Launch via a Python script

You can also launch the same pipeline via a Python script. This will essentially allow you to extend the functionality on offer within the Seqera Platform CLI by leveraging the flexibility and customisation options available in Python.

1. Download the [`launch_hello_world.py`](./examples/python/launch_hello_world.py) Python script and customise the `<YOUR_WORKSPACE>` and `<YOUR_COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT>` entries as required.

2. Launch the pipeline with `seqerakit`:

```bash
   python launch_hello_world.py
```

3. Login to your Seqera Platform instance and check the Runs page in the appropriate Workspace for the pipeline you just launched!

## Defining your YAML file using CLI options

All available options to provide as definitions in your YAML file can be determined by running the Seqera Platform CLI help command for your desired entity.

1. Retrieve CLI Options

To obtain a list of available CLI options for defining your YAML file, use the help command of the Seqera Platform CLI. For instance, if you want to configure a pipeline to be added to the Launchpad, you can view the options as follows:

```console
$ tw pipelines add -h

Usage: tw pipelines add [OPTIONS] PIPELINE_URL

Add a workspace pipeline.

Parameters:
*     PIPELINE_URL                         Nextflow pipeline URL.

Options:
* -n, --name=<name>                        Pipeline name.
  -w, --workspace=<workspace>              Workspace numeric identifier (TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID as default) or workspace reference as OrganizationName/WorkspaceName
  -d, --description=<description>          Pipeline description.
      --labels=<labels>[,<labels>...]      List of labels seperated by coma.
  -c, --compute-env=<computeEnv>           Compute environment name.
      --work-dir=<workDir>                 Path where the pipeline scratch data is stored.
  -p, --profile=<profile>[,<profile>...]   Comma-separated list of one or more configuration profile names you want to use for this pipeline execution.
      --params-file=<paramsFile>           Pipeline parameters in either JSON or YML format.
      --revision=<revision>                A valid repository commit Id, tag or branch name.
  ...
```
2. Define Key-Value Pairs in YAML

Translate each CLI option into a key-value pair in the YAML file. The structure of your YAML file should reflect the hierarchy and format of the CLI options. For instance:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: 'my_first_pipeline'
    url: 'https://github.com/username/my_pipeline'
    workspace: 'my_organization/my_workspace'
    description: 'My test pipeline'
    labels: 'yeast,test_data'
    compute-env: 'my_compute_environment'
    work-dir: 's3://my_bucket'
    profile: 'test'
    params-file: '/path/to/params.yaml'
    revision: '1.0'
```

In this example:

- `name`, `url`, `workspace`, etc., are the keys derived from the CLI options.
- The corresponding values are user-defined

### Best Practices:
- Ensure that the indentation and structure of the YAML file are correct - YAML is sensitive to formatting.
- Use quotes around strings that contain special characters or spaces.
- When listing multiple values (`labels`, `instance-types`, `allow-buckets`, etc), separate them with commas as shown above.
- For complex configurations, refer to the [Templates](./templates/) provided in this repository.


## Templates

We have provided template YAML files for each of the entities that can be created on Seqera Platform. These can be found in the [`templates/`](https://github.com/seqeralabs/blob/main/seqera-kit/templates) directory and should form a good starting point for you to add your own customization:

- [organizations.yml](./templates/organizations.yml)
- [teams.yml](./templates/teams.yml)
- [workspaces.yml](./templates/workspaces.yml)
- [participants.yml](./templates/participants.yml)
- [credentials.yml](./templates/credentials.yml)
- [secrets.yml](./templates/secrets.yml)
- [compute-envs.yml](./templates/compute-envs.yml)
- [actions.yml](./templates/actions.yml)
- [datasets.yml](./templates/datasets.yml)
- [labels.yml](./templates/labels.yml)
- [pipelines.yml](./templates/pipelines.yml)
- [launch.yml](./templates/launch.yml)

## Real world example

Please see [`seqerakit-e2e.yml`](./examples/yaml/seqerakit-e2e.yml) for an end-to-end example that highlights how you can use `seqerakit` to create everything sequentially in Seqera Platform all the way from creating a new Organization to launching a pipeline.

You can modify this YAML to similarly create Seqera Platform resources end-to-end for your setup. This YAML encodes environment variables to protect sensitive keys, usernames, and passwords that are required to create or add certain resources (i.e. credentials, compute environments). Prior to running it with `seqerakit examples/yaml/seqerakit-e2e.yml`, you will have to set the following environment variables:

```console
$TOWER_GITHUB_PASSWORD
$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD
$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
$AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN
$AZURE_BATCH_KEY
$AZURE_STORAGE_KEY
$GOOGLE_KEY
$SENTIEON_LICENSE_BASE64
```
