## API

### Maximum results returned

Use pagination to fetch the results in smaller chunks through multiple API calls with `max` and `offset` parameters. The error below indidcates that you have run into the maximum result limit:

`{object} length parameter cannot be greater than 100 (current value={value_sent})`

To remedy this, see the example requests below:

```
curl -X GET "https://$TOWER_SERVER_URL/workflow/$WORKFLOW_ID/tasks? workspaceId=$WORKSPACE_ID&max=100" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
curl -X GET "https://$TOWER_SERVER_URL/workflow/$WORKFLOW_ID/tasks? workspaceId=$WORKSPACE_ID&max=100&offset=100" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## tw CLI

**Connection errors when creating or viewing AWS Batch compute environments with `tw compute-envs` commands**

tw CLI v0.8 and earlier does not support the `SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED` [allocation strategy](./compute-envs/aws-batch.mdx#advanced-options) in AWS Batch. Creating or viewing AWS Batch compute environments with this allocation strategy will lead to errors. This issue was [addressed in CLI v0.9](https://github.com/seqeralabs/tower-cli/issues/332).

**Segfault errors**

Users of legacy tw CLI versions may experience segmentation faults in older operating systems.

To resolve segfault errors, first upgrade your tw CLI to the latest available version. If errors persist, use our alternative Java [JAR-based solution](https://github.com/seqeralabs/tower-cli/releases/download/v0.8.0/tw.jar).

**Insecure HTTP errors**

_ERROR: You are trying to connect to an insecure server: `http://hostname:port/api` if you want to force the connection use '--insecure'. NOT RECOMMENDED!_

This error indicates that your Seqera host accepts connections using insecure HTTP instead of HTTPS. If your host cannot be configured to accept HTTPS connections, add the `--insecure` flag **before** your CLI command:

```
tw --insecure info
```

:::caution
HTTP must not be used in production environments.

**Resume/relaunch runs with tw CLI**

Runs can be [relaunched](./launch/launchpad.mdx#relaunch-pipeline-run) with `tw runs relaunch` command.

```
tw runs relaunch -i 3adMwRdD75ah6P -w 161372824019700
