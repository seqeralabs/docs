## OpenID Connect related variables

- `TOWER_OIDC_CLIENT`: The client ID provided by your authentication service.
- `TOWER_OIDC_SECRET`: The client secret provided by your authentication service.
- `TOWER_OIDC_ISSUER`: The authentication service URL to which Tower connects to authenticate the sign-in request e.g. `https://dev-886323.okta.com/oauth2/default`.

Some providers require the full authentication service URL (such as the OKTA example above), while others require only the SSO root domain (without the trailing sub-directories).

In your OpenID provider settings, specify the following URL as callback address or authorised redirect:

```
https://<YOUR HOST OR IP>/oauth/callback/oidc
```

### Okta identity provider

To setup [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) as the OpenID provider:

- Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.
- From the Admin Console side navigation, click Applications > Applications.
- Select **Add Application**.
- Select **Create New App**.
- Select the **OpenID Connect** sign-on method.
- Select **Create**.
- Enter a name for your new app integration e.g. `Tower`.
- In the **Configure OpenID Connect**, add the following redirect URIs.
  - **Sign-in redirect URIs** : `https://<YOUR HOST OR IP>/oauth/callback/oidc`
  - **Sign-out redirect URIs** : `https://<YOUR HOST OR IP>/logout`
- Select **Save**.

Okta app automatically navigates to your new application settings. You can use these details to complete the Tower configuration by specifying the following variables:

- `TOWER_OIDC_CLIENT` : Copy from **Client ID** field in the **Client Credentials** section within the **General** tab for the corresponding app client configuration.
- `TOWER_OIDC_SECRET`: Copy from **Client secret** field in the **Client Credentials** section within the **General** tab for the corresponding app client configuration.
- `TOWER_OIDC_ISSUER` : Copy the Okta issuer URL, in the **OpenID Connect ID Token** section in the **Sign On** tab for the corresponding app client configuration.

Check the _OpenID Connect_ section above for details.

### GitHub identity provider

To use GitHub as SSO provider for Tower, register your Tower instance as a GitHub OAuth App
in your organization settings page, e.g., https://github.com/organizations/{YOUR-ORGANIZATION}/settings/applications.

When creating the OAuth App specify the following path as callback URL: `https://{your-deployment-domain-name}/oauth/callback/github` (replacing the `{your-deployment-domain-name}` placeholder with the domain name of your deployment).

Finally include the following variable in the backend environment configuration:

- `TOWER_GITHUB_CLIENT`: The client id provided by GitHub when register the new OAuth App.
- `TOWER_GITHUB_SECRET`: The client secret provided by GitHub when register the new OAuth App.

### Google identity provider

To use Google as SSO provider for Tower:

- Visit https://console.developers.google.com and create a new project
- From the sidebar, click the **Credentials** tab
- Select **Create credentials** and choose **OAuth client ID** from the drop-down
- On the next page, select **Web Application** type
- Enter the redirect URL: `https://{your-deployment-domain-name}/oauth/callback/google` (replacing the `{your-deployment-domain-name}` placeholder with the domain name of your deployment).
- Confirm the operation. You will then receive a _Client ID_ and _secret ID_.

Finally, include the _Client ID_ and _Secret ID_ in following variables in the Tower backend environment configuration:

- `TOWER_GOOGLE_CLIENT`: The client id provided by Google in the above steps.
- `TOWER_GOOGLE_SECRET`: The client secret provided by Google in the above steps.

### Keycloak identity provider

To use [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as identity provider for Tower, configure in your Keycloak service a new _client_ following these steps:

- In the _Realm settings_ make sure the _Endpoints_ field include "OpenID Endpoint Configuration"
- Open the _Client_ page and click \*Create" to setup a new client for Tower
- In the _Settings_ tag, make sure to include the following fields
  - **Client Id**: `tower` for the sake of this tutorial or any other Id of your choice
  - **Enabled**: `ON`
  - **Client Protocol**: `openid-connect`
  - **Access Type**: `confidential`
  - **Standard Flow Enabled**: `ON`
  - **Implicit Flow Enabled**: `OFF`
  - **Direct Access Grants Enabled**: `ON`
  - **Valid Redirect URIs**: https:///\<YOUR HOST\>//oauth/callback/oidc e.g. `http://localhost:8000/oauth/callback/oidc`
  - Click _Save_
- In the _Credentials_ tab, take note of the **Secret** field.
- In the _Keys_ tab, make sure the field **Use JWKS URL** is `OFF`.

Complete the setup on Tower side adding the following environment variables to your configuration:

- `TOWER_OIDC_CLIENT`: The client Id assigned to the above client setup e.g. `tower`.
- `TOWER_OIDC_SECRET`: The content of the **Secret** field assigned in the above client setup.
- `TOWER_OIDC_ISSUER`: The Keycloak issuer URL, you can find it in the _Realm Settings_ page and
  clicking on the _OpenID Configuration_ in the **Endpoints** field. It shows a JSON payload, copy & paste the value
  associated to the entry `issues`, e.g. `http://localhost:9000/auth/realms/master`.

### Azure AD OIDC integration

To make use of [Azure AD for the OIDC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc) as identity provider for Tower, configure a new client in your Azure AD service:

1.  Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1.  Navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1.  Select **Manage Tenants**.
1.  Create a new **Tenant** (e.g. `NextflowTowerOrg`).
1.  Navigate to the newly-created Tenant.
1.  Go to **App Registrations**.
1.  Click **New Registration**.

   1.  Enter a name for the application.
   2.  Specify the scope of user verification (e.g. single tenant, multi-tenant, personal MSFT accounts, etc).

   :::note
   The Azure AD app must have user consent settings configured to "Allow user consent for apps" to ensure that admin approval is not required for each application login. See [User consent settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent?pivots=portal#configure-user-consent-settings).
   :::

1.  Specify the **Redirect** (callback) URI (NOTE: Microsoft requires that this URI uses `HTTPS`)

1.  Open the newly-created app:
   1.  Note the Application (client) ID under the Essentials table
   2.  Generate Client credentials under the Essentials table
   3.  Click Endpoints and note the OpenID Connect metadata document URI
1.  Add users to your tenant as required.

1.  Complete the setup on Tower side adding the following environment variables to your configuration:

    ```bash
    TOWER_OIDC_CLIENT=<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>
    TOWER_OIDC_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_SECRET>
    TOWER_OIDC_ISSUER=<YOUR_OIDC_METADATA_URL_UP_TO_"v2.0">   (e.g. https://login.microsoftonline.com/000000-0000-0000-00-0000000000000/v2.0)
    ```

1.  Add `auth-oidc` to the end of the `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS` value for both the `cron` and `backend` services.

## Configure user access allow list

When using a public authentication provider such as Google or GitHub, you may need
to restrict the access to specific user email addresses or domains.

Replace the `<PROVIDER>` placeholder with `github`, `google`, or `oidc` (`oidc` is used to specify any other authentication service based on OpenID Connect, e.g. Okta, AzureAD, Keycloak, etc.). You will need to include each provider separately, if specifying more than one.

The allow list entries are case-insensitive.
