### Pipeline launch form

The **Launch Form** can be used for launching pipelines and for adding pipelines to the **Launchpad**.

To launch a pipeline:

1.  Select **Start Quick Launch** in the navigation bar. The Launch Form will appear.

1.  Select a **Compute Environment** from the available options.

   Visit the [Compute Environment](../compute-envs/overview.mdx) documentation to learn how to create an environment for your preferred execution platform.

1.  Enter a repository URL for the **Pipeline to launch** (e.g. `https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq.git`).

:::tip
Nextflow pipelines are just Git repositories and they can reside on any public or private Git-hosting platform. See [Git Integration](../git/overview.mdx) in the Tower docs and [Pipeline Sharing](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/sharing.html) in the Nextflow docs for more details.
:::

1.  You can select a **Revision number** to use a specific version of the pipeline.

   The Git default branch (e.g. `main` or `master`) or `manifest.defaultBranch` in the Nextflow configuration will be used by default.

1.  Enter the **Work directory**, which corresponds to the Nextflow work directory.

   The default work directory of the compute environment will be used by default.

:::caution
The credentials associated with the compute environment must be able to access the work directory (e.g. an S3 bucket).
:::

1.  Select any **Config profiles** you would like to use.

    Visit the Nextflow [Config profiles](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles) documentation for more details.

1.  Enter any **Pipeline parameters** in YAML or JSON format.

        YAML example:
        ```yaml
        reads: 's3://nf-bucket/exome-data/ERR013140_{1,2}.fastq.bz2'
        paired_end: true
        ```

:::tip
In YAML, quotes should be used for paths but not for numbers or Booleans.
:::

1.  Select **Launch** to launch the pipeline.
