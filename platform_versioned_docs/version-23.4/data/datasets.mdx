Datasets in Seqera Platform are CSV (comma-separated values) and TSV (tab-separated values) files stored in a workspace. They are used as inputs to pipelines to simplify data management, minimize user data-input errors, and facilitate reproducible workflows.

The most commonly used datasets for Nextflow pipelines are samplesheets, where each row consists of a sample, the location of files for that sample (such as fastq files), and other sample details. For example, [nf-core/rnaseq](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq) works with input datasets (samplesheets) containing sample names, fastq file locations, and indications of strandedness. The Seqera Community Showcase sample dataset for _nf-core/rnaseq_ looks like this:

**Example rnaseq dataset**

:::note
Use [Data Explorer](../data/data-explorer.mdx) to browse for cloud storage objects directly and copy the object paths to be used in your datasets.
:::

The combination of datasets, [secrets](../secrets/overview.mdx), and [actions](../pipeline-actions/overview.mdx) in the application allows you to automate workflows to curate your data and maintain and launch pipelines based on specific events. See [here](https://seqera.io/blog/workflow-automation/) for an example of pipeline workflow automation using Seqera.

- Datasets reduce errors that occur due to manual data entry when you launch pipelines.
- Datasets can be generated automatically in response to events (such as S3 storage new file notifications).
- Datasets can streamline differential data analysis when using the same pipeline to launch a run for each dataset as it becomes available.

For your pipeline to use your dataset as input during runtime, information about the dataset and file format must be included in the relevant parameters of your [pipeline schema](../pipeline-schema/overview.mdx). The pipeline schema specifies the accepted dataset file type in the `mimetype` attribute (either `text/csv` or `text/tsv`).

## Dataset validation and file content requirements

Seqera doesn't validate your dataset file contents. While datasets can contain static file links, you're responsible for maintaining the access to that data.

Datasets can point to files stored in various locations, such as Amazon S3 or GitHub. To stage the file paths defined in the dataset, Nextflow requires access to the infrastructure where the files reside, whether on cloud or HPC systems. Add the access keys for data sources that require authentication to your [secrets](../secrets/overview.mdx).

### Create a dataset

All Seqera users have access to the datasets feature in organization workspaces. To create a new dataset:

1. Open the **Datasets** tab in your organization workspace.
2. Select **New dataset**.
3. Complete the **Name** and **Description** fields using information relevant to your dataset.
4. Add the dataset file to your workspace with drag-and-drop or the system file explorer dialog.
5. For dataset files that use the first row for column names, customize the dataset view with the **First row as header** option.

:::note
The size of the dataset file must not exceed 10 MB.
:::

## Dataset versions

Seqera can accommodate multiple versions of a dataset. To add a new version for an existing dataset, follow these steps:

1. Select **Edit** next to the dataset you wish to update.
2. In the Edit dialog, select **Add a new version**.
3. Upload the newer version of the dataset and select **Update**.

:::caution
All subsequent versions of a dataset must be the same format (CSV or TSV) as the initial version.
:::

### Use a dataset

To use a dataset with the saved pipelines in your workspace:

1. Open any pipeline that contains a pipeline schema from the [Launchpad](../launch/launchpad.mdx).
2. Select the input field for the pipeline, removing any default value.
3. Pick the dataset to use as input to your pipeline.

:::note
The input field drop-down menu will only display datasets that match the file type specified in the `nextflow_schema.json` of the chosen pipeline. If the schema specifies `"mimetype": "text/csv"`, no TSV datasets will be available for use with that pipeline, and vice-versa.
