The Seqera Platform public API provides endpoints to manage Nextflow workflows programmatically, allowing organizations to incorporate Seqera seamlessly into their existing processes.

:::note
As of version 23.4, the Seqera API is live on `https://api.cloud.seqera.io`. The legacy API `https://api.tower.nf` remains fully operational, so existing API integrations will continue to perform as expected. Deprecation of the legacy API will be communicated well in advance to avoid any breaking changes to your integrations.
:::

The API can be accessed from `https://api.cloud.seqera.io`. All API endpoints use HTTPS, and all request and response payloads use [JSON](https://www.json.org/) encoding. All timestamps use the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) date-time standard format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.

### OpenAPI

The Seqera API uses the OpenAPI standard. The current OpenAPI schema can be found [here](https://cloud.seqera.io/openapi/seqera-api-latest.yml).

:::tip
For more information on the OpenAPI standard, see [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/).

### Endpoints

See [Seqera Platform services API](https://cloud.seqera.io/openapi/index.html) for a detailed list of all endpoints. This page includes request and response payload examples, and the ability to test each endpoint interactively.

### Programmatic API

You can use tools such as [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client) to generate a programmatic API for a particular language (e.g., Python) based on the OpenAPI schema. However, we do not guarantee that any OpenAPI client generators will work with Seqera API.

### Authentication

The API requires an authentication token to be specified in each API request using the
[Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication) HTTP header.

Your personal authorization token can be found in the user menu under [**Your tokens**](https://cloud.seqera.io/tokens).

To create a new access token, provide token name and select **Create**.

The token is only displayed once. Store your token in a safe place.

Once created, use the token to authenticate requests to the API via cURL, Postman, or within your code.

### cURL example

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ...YTk0" https://api.cloud.seqera.io/workflow
```

:::tip
Your token must be included in every API call. See [Bearer token authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication) for more information.

### Parameters

Some API `GET` methods will accept standard `query` parameters, which are defined in the documentation. Optional parameters such as page size, number (when available), and file name can be submitted as query parameters. `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests require additional parameters to be provided in your request body.

Several head parameters are also accepted, such as `Authorization` for bearer access tokens or `Accept-Version` to indicate the desired API version to use (default version 1):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer QH..E5M="
     -H "Accept-Version:1"
     -X POST https://api.cloud.seqera.io/domain/{item_id}?queryString={value}
     -d { params: { "key":"value" } }

```

### Client errors

Two typical standard errors, i.e., not `200` or `204` status responses, are returned by the API.

#### Bad Request

The request payload is not properly defined or the query parameters are invalid.

```json
{
  "message": "Unexpected error while processing - Error ID: 54apnFENQxbvCr23JaIjLb"
}
```

#### Forbidden

Your access token is invalid or expired. This response may also imply that the entry point you are trying to access is not available. Check your request syntax for typos, and confirm that your access token is valid.

```bash
Status: 403 Forbidden
```

### Rate limiting

For all API requests, there is a limit of 20 calls per second, per access token (72000 calls per hour).
