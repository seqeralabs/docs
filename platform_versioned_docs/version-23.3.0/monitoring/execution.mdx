### Run execution details

Select a workflow run from the **Runs** tab to view execution details. This view contains:

- [Run information](#run-information) with command-line, parameters, configuration, and execution logs in real-time.
- [General summary](./summary.mdx#general-summary) and [task statuses](./summary.mdx#task-status)
- List of pipeline [processes](./processes.mdx)
- [Aggregated stats](./aggregate_stats.mdx#aggregate-stats), [load](./aggregate_stats.mdx#load), and [utilization](./aggregate_stats.mdx#utilization)
- [Tasks](./tasks.mdx#tasks) and [metrics](./tasks.mdx#metrics)

### Run information

This section is composed of several tabs containing details about the Nextflow execution:

- The Nextflow **Command line** that was executed.
- The **Parameters** that were provided to the pipeline (taken from the configuration `params` scope).
- The **Configuration** files and the final resolved configuration.
- The **Execution log** from the main Nextflow process, updated in real-time.

### Save run as pipeline

**Available from version 23.1**

From the **Runs** list, any run can be saved as a new pipeline for future use (regardless of run status). Select the item menu to the right of any run in the list, then select **Save as pipeline**. In the dialog box shown, you can edit the pipeline name (the run name is pre-filled by default), add labels, and **Save**.

To review and edit any run details prior to saving the pipeline, select **Review and edit** near the top of the dialog window. Once saved, the new pipeline is listed on the Launchpad and can be run from the same workspace it was created.
