Seqera Platform is available in two deployment editions and can be accessed via the web user interface (UI), [API](../api/overview.mdx), [CLI](../cli/cli.mdx), or in Nextflow directly using a flag.

## Seqera Platform editions

### Seqera Platform Cloud

The hosted Seqera Cloud edition is recommended for users who are new to Seqera. It's an ideal choice for individuals and organizations looking to set up quickly. See [Community Showcase](../getting-started/community-showcase.mdx) for instructions to launch your first pipeline. Seqera Cloud has a limit of five concurrent workflow runs per user. It's available free of charge at [cloud.tower.nf](https://tower.nf/login).

### Seqera Platform Enterprise

[Seqera Platform Enterprise](../enterprise/index.mdx) is installed in an organization's own cloud or on-premises infrastructure. It includes:

- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Pipeline execution Launchpad
- Cloud resource provisioning
- Pipeline actions and event-based execution
- LDAP and OpenID authentication
- Enterprise role-based access control (RBAC)
- Full-featured API
- Dedicated support for Nextflow and Seqera Platform

To install Seqera Platform in your organization's infrastructure, [contact us](https://cloud.tower.nf/demo/) for a demo to discuss your requirements.

## How to use Seqera Platform

You can access your Seqera instance through the UI, the [API](../api/overview.mdx), the [CLI](../cli/cli.mdx), or in Nextflow directly using the `-with-tower` option.

### Seqera Platform UI

1. Create an account and log in to Seqera at [cloud.tower.nf](https://cloud.tower.nf).

   :::note
   Platform login sessions remain active as long as the application browser tab remains open and active. When the browser window is terminated, automatic logout occurs within 6 hours by default.
   :::

2. Create and configure a new [compute environment](../compute-envs/overview.mdx).
3. Start [launching pipelines](../launch/launchpad.mdx).

### Seqera API

See [API](../api/overview.mdx).

### Seqera CLI

See [CLI](../cli/cli.mdx).

### Nextflow `-with-tower`

If you have an existing environment where you run Nextflow directly, you can still leverage Seqera Platform capabilities by executing your Nextflow run with a `with-tower` flag:

1. Create an account and log in to Seqera.
2. From your personal workspace: Go to the user menu and select **Settings > Your tokens**.
3. Select **Add token**.
4. Enter a unique name for your token, then select **Add**.
5. Copy and store your token securely.

:::caution
The access token is displayed only once. Save the token value before closing the **Personal Access Token** window.
:::

6. Open a terminal window and create environment variables to store the Seqera access token and Nextflow version. Replace `<your access token>` with your newly-created token.

   ```bash
   export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your access token>
   export NXF_VER=23.1.3
   ```

:::note
Bearer token support requires Nextflow version 20.10.0 or later. Set with the `NXF_VER` environment variable.
:::

7. To submit a pipeline to a [workspace](../orgs-and-teams/workspace-management.mdx) using Nextflow, add the workspace ID to your environment:

   ```bash
   export TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID=000000000000000
   ```

   To find your workspace ID, select your organization in Seqera and navigate to the **Workspaces** tab.

8. Run your Nextflow pipeline with the `-with-tower` flag:

   ```bash
   nextflow run main.nf -with-tower
   ```

   Replace `main.nf` with the filename of your Nextflow script.

You can now monitor your workflow runs in the Seqera interface. To configure and execute Nextflow pipelines in cloud environments, see [compute environments](../compute-envs/overview.mdx).

:::tip
See the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html?highlight=tower#scope-tower) for further run configuration options using Nextflow configuration files.
