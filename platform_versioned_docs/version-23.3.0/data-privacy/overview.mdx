### Your data

Your data stays strictly within **your** infrastructure.

When you launch a workflow through Seqera Platform, you need to connect your infrastructure (HPC/VMs/K8s) by creating the appropriate credentials and compute environment in a workspace. The application then uses this configuration to trigger a Nextflow workflow within your infrastructure similar to what is done via the Nextflow CLI. The application doesn't manipulate any data itself and no data is transferred to the infrastructure where it's running.

It may be possible to access some data within your storage from the application interface - for example, viewing logs and reports generated in a pipeline run. However, this data is never stored within the platform's infrastructure.

### Metadata stored by Seqera Platform

Workflow execution metadata is sent by the Nextflow runtime to the application when:

- When you launch a workflow with the application.
  - When you use the `-with-tower` option at the command line.
- When `tower.enabled` is specified in the Nextflow config.

The following sections describe the data structure and metadata fields collected by Seqera Platform.

#### Workflow metadata

The following metadata fields are collected and stored by the application backend during a workflow execution:
