## Overview

**Organization workspaces** extend the functionality of [user workspaces](../getting-started/workspace.mdx) by adding the ability to fine-tune access levels for specific members, collaborators, or teams. This is achieved by managing **participants** in the organization workspaces.

Organizations consist of members, while workspaces consist of participants.

:::note
A workspace participant may be a member of the workspace organization or a collaborator within that workspace only. Collaborators count toward the total number of workspace participants. See [Usage limits](../limits/limits.mdx).
:::

### Create a new workspace

Organization owners and admins can create a new workspace within an organization:

1. Go to the **Workspaces** tab of the organization page.
2. Select **Add Workspace**.
3. Enter the **Name** and **Full name** for the workspace.
4. Optionally, add a **Description** for the workspace.
5. Under **Visibility**, select either **Private** or **Shared**. Private visibility means that workspace pipelines are only accessible to workspace participants.
6. Select **Add**.

:::tip
Optional workspace fields can be modified after workspace creation, either by using the **Edit** option on the workspace listing for an organization or by accessing the **Settings** tab within the workspace page, provided that you are the **Owner** of the workspace.
:::

Apart from the **Participants** tab, the organization workspace is similar to the **user workspace**. As such, the relation to [runs](../launch/launch.mdx), [pipeline actions](../pipeline-actions/overview.mdx), [compute environments](../compute-envs/overview.mdx) and [credentials](../credentials/overview.mdx) is the same.

### Add a new participant

To add a new participant to a workspace:

1. Go to the **Participants** tab in the workspace menu.
2. Select **Add participant**.
3. Enter the **Name** of the new participant.
4. Optionally, update the participant **role**. For more information on **roles**, see [participant roles](#participant-roles).

:::tip
A new workspace participant can be an existing organization member, team, or collaborator.
:::

### Participant roles

Organization owners can assign role-based access levels to any of the workspace **participants** in an organization workspace.

:::tip
It is also possible to group **members** and **collaborators** into **teams** and apply a role to that team. Members and collaborators inherit the access role of the team.
:::

There are five roles available for every workspace participant.

1. **Owner**: The participant has full permissions for all resources within the workspace, including the workspace settings.

2. **Admin**: The participant has full permissions for resources associated with the workspace. They can create, modify, and delete pipelines, compute environments, actions, and credentials. They can add or remove users from the workspace but cannot access the workspace settings.

3. **Maintain**: The participant can launch pipelines and modify pipeline executions (e.g., they can change the pipeline launch compute environments, parameters, pre/post-run scripts, and Nextflow configuration) and create new pipelines in the Launchpad. Users with maintain permissions cannot modify compute environments and credentials.

4. **Launch**: The participant can launch pipelines and modify the pipeline input/output parameters in the Launchpad. They cannot modify the launch configuration or other resources.

5. **View**: The participant can view workspace pipelines and runs in read-only mode.

### Workspace run monitoring

To allow users executing pipelines from the command-line to share their runs with a given workspace, see [Getting started](../getting-started/usage.mdx).
