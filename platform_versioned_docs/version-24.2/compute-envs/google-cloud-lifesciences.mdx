This guide assumes you have an existing Google Cloud account. Sign up for a free account [here](https://cloud.google.com/). Seqera Platform provides integration to Google Cloud via the [Cloud Life Sciences API](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/reference/rest).

This guide is split into two parts:

1. How to configure your Google Cloud account to use the Cloud Life Sciences API.
2. How to create a Google Life Sciences compute environment in Seqera.

## Configure Google Cloud

### Create a project

Navigate to the [Google Project Selector page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2) and either select an existing project or select **Create project**.

Enter a name for your new project, e.g., _tower-nf_.

If you are part of an organization, the location will default to your organization.

### Enable billing

See [here](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) to enable billing in your Google Cloud account.

### Enable APIs

See [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=lifesciences.googleapis.com%2Ccompute.googleapis.com%2Cstorage-api.googleapis.com) to enable the following APIs for your project:

- Cloud Life Sciences API
- Compute Engine API
- Cloud Storage API

Select your project from the dropdown menu and select **Enable**.

Alternatively, select your project in the navigation bar and enable each API manually from these pages:

- [Cloud Life Sciences API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/lifesciences.googleapis.com)

- [Compute Engine API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/compute.googleapis.com)

- [Cloud Storage API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/storage-api.googleapis.com)

### IAM

Seqera requires a service account with appropriate permissions to interact with your Google Cloud resources.

**Create a service account**

1. In the navigation menu, select **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**.
2. Select the email address of the **Compute Engine default service account**.
3. Select **Keys > Add key > Create new key**.
4. Select **JSON** as the key type.
5. Select **Create**.

A JSON file will be downloaded to your computer. This file contains the credentials needed to configure the compute environment in Seqera.

You can manage your key from the **Service Accounts** page.

### Cloud Storage bucket

Google Cloud Storage is a type of **object storage**. To access files and store the results for your pipelines, create a **Cloud bucket** that your Seqera service account can access.

**Create a Cloud Storage bucket**

1. In the hamburger menu (**â‰¡**), select **Cloud Storage > Create bucket**.
2. Enter a name for your bucket. You will reference this name when creating the compute environment in Seqera.

:::caution
Do not use underscores (`_`) in your bucket name. Use hyphens (`-`) instead.
:::

3. Select **Region** for the **Location type** and select the **Location** for your bucket. You will reference this location when creating the compute environment in Seqera.
4. Select **Standard** for the default storage class.
5. Select **Uniform** for the **Access control**.

:::note
The Cloud Life Sciences API is available in a limited number of [locations](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/concepts/locations). These locations are only used to store metadata about the pipeline operations. The storage bucket and compute resources can be in any region.
:::

6. Select **Create**.
7. Once the bucket is created, you will be redirected to the **Bucket details** page.
8. Select **Permissions**, then **+ Add**.
9. Copy the email address of the Compute Engine default service account into **New principals**.
10. Select the following roles:

    - Storage Admin
    - Storage Legacy Bucket Owner
    - Storage Legacy Object Owner
    - Storage Object Creator

## Seqera compute environment

:::caution
Your Seqera compute environment uses resources that you may be charged for in your Google Cloud account. See [Cloud costs](../monitoring/cloud-costs.mdx) for guidelines to manage cloud resources effectively and prevent unexpected costs.
:::

After your Google Cloud resources have been created, create a new Seqera compute environment.

**Create a Seqera Google Cloud Life Sciences compute environment**

1. In a workspace, select **Compute Environments > New Environment**.
2. Enter a descriptive name for this environment, e.g., _Google Life Sciences (europe-west2)_.
3. Select **Google Life Sciences** as the target platform.
4. From the **Credentials** drop-down, select existing Google Cloud credentials, or add new credentials by selecting the **+** button. If you choose to use existing credentials, skip to step 7.

:::tip
You can create multiple credentials in your Seqera workspace. See [Credentials](../credentials/overview.mdx).
:::

5. Enter a name for the credentials, e.g., _Google Cloud Credentials_.
6. Enter the **Service account key** created previously.
7. Select the [**Region** and **Zones**](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available) where you wish to execute pipelines. Leave the **Location** empty for the Cloud Life Sciences API to use the closest available location.
8. In the **Pipeline work directory** field, enter your storage bucket URL, e.g., `gs://my-bucket`. This bucket must be accessible in the region selected in the previous step.

    :::note
    When you specify a Cloud Storage bucket as your work directory, this bucket is used for the Nextflow [cloud cache](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cache-and-resume.html#cache-stores) by default. You can specify an alternative cache location with the **Nextflow config file** field on the pipeline [launch](../launch/launchpad.mdx#launch-form) form.
    :::

9. You can enable **Preemptible** to use preemptible instances, which have significantly reduced cost compared to on-demand instances.
10. You can use a **Filestore file system** to automatically mount a Google Filestore volume in your pipelines.
11. Apply [**Resource labels**](../resource-labels/overview.mdx) to the cloud resources consumed by this compute environment. Workspace default resource labels are prefilled.
12. Expand **Staging options** to include:
    - Optional [pre- or post-run Bash scripts](../launch/advanced.mdx#pre--post-run-scripts) that execute before or after the Nextflow pipeline execution in your environment.
    - Global Nextflow configuration settings for all pipeline runs launched with this compute environment. Configuration settings in this field override the same values in the pipeline Nextflow config file. 
13. Use the **Environment variables** option to specify custom environment variables for the Head job and/or Compute jobs.
14. Configure any advanced options you need:
    - Enable **Use Private Address** to ensure that your Google Cloud VMs aren't accessible to the public internet.
    - Use **Boot disk size** to control the boot disk size of VMs.
    - Use **Head Job CPUs** and **Head Job Memory** to specify the CPUs and memory allocated for head jobs.
15. Select **Create** to finalize the compute environment setup.

See [Launch pipelines](../launch/launchpad.mdx) to start executing workflows in your Google Cloud Life Sciences compute environment.
