Configure **workspace credentials** in Seqera Platform to store the access keys and tokens for your [compute environments](../compute-envs/overview.mdx) and [Git hosting services](../git/overview.mdx).

From version 22.3, you can configure **container registry credentials** to be used by the [Wave container service](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/wave.html) to authenticate to private and public container registries like Docker Hub, Google Artifact Registry, Quay, etc.

See the **Container registry credentials** section for registry-specific instructions.

:::note
All credentials are (AES-256) encrypted before secure storage and not exposed in an unencrypted way by any Seqera API.
