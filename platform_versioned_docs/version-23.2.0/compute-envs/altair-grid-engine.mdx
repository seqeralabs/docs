[Altair Grid Engine](https://www.altair.com/grid-engine/) is a workload manager maintained by Altair Engineering, Inc.

Tower streamlines the deployment of Nextflow pipelines into both cloud-based and on-prem Grid Engine clusters.

## Requirements

To launch pipelines into a **Grid Engine** cluster from Tower, the following requirements must be satisfied:

- The cluster should allow outbound connections to the Tower web service.
- The cluster queue used to run the Nextflow head job must be able to submit cluster jobs.
- The Nextflow runtime version **21.02.0-edge** (or later) must be installed on the cluster.

## Compute environment

To create a new compute environment for **Grid Engine** in Tower:

1.  In a workspace, select **Compute environments** and then **New environment**.

1.  Enter a descriptive name for this environment, e.g., "Grid Engine".

1.  Select **Altair Grid Engine** as the target platform.

1.  Select your credentials, or select **+** and **SSH** or **Tower Agent** to add new credentials.

1.  Enter a name for the credentials.

1.  Enter the absolute path of the **Work directory** to be used on the cluster.

1.  Enter the absolute path of the **Launch directory** to be used on the cluster. If omitted, it will be the same as the work directory.

1.  Enter the **Login hostname**. This is usually the hostname or public IP address of the cluster's login node.

1.  Enter the **Head queue name**. This is the cluster queue to which the Nextflow job will be submitted.

1.  Enter the **Compute queue name**. This is the cluster queue to which the Nextflow job will submit tasks.

:::tip
The compute queue can be overridden by the Nextflow pipeline configuration. See the Nextflow [documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#queue) for more details.
:::

1.  Expand **Staging options** to include optional pre- or post-run Bash scripts that execute before or after the Nextflow pipeline execution in your environment.

1.  You can use the **Environment variables** option to specify custom environment variables for the Head job and/or Compute jobs.

1.  Configure any advanced options described below, as needed.

1.  Select **Create** to finalize the creation of the compute environment.

Jump to the documentation for [launching pipelines](../launch/launchpad.mdx).

### Advanced options

- Use the **Nextflow queue size** to limit the number of jobs that Nextflow can submit to the scheduler at the same time.

- Use the **Head job submit options** to specify Grid Engine options for the head job. You can optionally apply these options to compute jobs as well:
