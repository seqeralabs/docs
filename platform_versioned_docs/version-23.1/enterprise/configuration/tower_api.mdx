## Tower API configuration

To enable the OpenAPI specification in your deployment, similar to [tower.nf/openapi/index.html](https://api.cloud.seqera.io/openapi/index.html), use the `TOWER_ENABLE_OPENAPI` environment variable.

```env
TOWER_ENABLE_OPENAPI=true
```

:::note
If you'd like to use the [Tower CLI](https://github.com/seqeralabs/tower-cli), then you'll need to enable the API endpoints.
