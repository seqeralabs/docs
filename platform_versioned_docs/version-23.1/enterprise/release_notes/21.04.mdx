### License key

As of version `21.02.x`, a license key must be provided to enable the Tower
deployment feature. The license key should be specified using the configuration
variable `TOWER_LICENSE`. If you don't have a license key, contact sales@seqera.io.

### Compute environments

The Tower compute environments to be made available
to users must be specified in the Tower configuration.

The following ids options are available:

- `awsbatch-platform`: AWS Batch cloud compute service
- `gls-platform`: Google LifeSciences cloud compute service
- `azbatch-platform`: Azure Batch cloud compute service
- `lsf-platform`: IBM LSF batch scheduler
- `slurm-platform`: Slurm batch scheduler
- `altair-platform`: Altair PBS Pro batch scheduler
- `univa-platform`: (Univa/Sun) GridEngine
- `k8s-platform`: Kubernetes compute platform
- `eks-platform`: AWS EKS compute platform
- `gke-platform`: Google GKE compute platform

Choose one or more of these platform ids and _append_ to your current `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS`
variable, separating them via a comma.

### Database schema

This Tower version requires a database schema update which requires the scheduling of several minutes of service downtime.

PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO UPGRADE YOUR TOWER VERSION:

- Stop the current Tower service
- Make a full database backup
- Update your environment with the new Tower enterprise containers
- Restore the service

Find below more detailed instructions for your reference deployment.

#### Kubernetes based deployment

**1.** Stop the Tower service using the following command:

```
kubectl delete deployment frontend
kubectl delete deployment backend
kubectl delete deployment cron

```

**2.** Update the Tower container images in the Kubernetes manifest yaml files to:

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v21.04.9
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v21.04.9
```

If you are using AWS Batch with a custom launcher job definition, you will need to update it to use the following container image (please refer the configuration section for details):

```
public.ecr.aws/seqera-labs/tower/nf-launcher:21.04.0
```

Refer to the manifests included in the Kubernetes section for details.

**3.** Apply the changes for the Tower _cron_ service using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f tower-cron.yml
```

:::note
This task will automatically run the Tower database schema update tool. It may take some minutes to complete.
:::

**4.** Once the `cron` container is in `running` status, deploy the Tower backend and frontend services using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f tower-svc.yml
```

#### Docker compose deployment

**1.** Stop the current deployment using the command `docker-compose stop`.
**2.** Make backup of the Tower database.
**3.** Update the docker-compose.yml file with the following container images:

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v21.04.9
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v21.04.9
```

**4.** Restart the service using the command `docker-compose start`.

#### Custom deployment script

**1.** Stop the current Tower deployment.
**2.** Make a Tower database backup.
**3.** Pull or update the Tower container images references in your
deployment script(s) to:

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v21.04.9
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v21.04.9
```

If you are using AWS Batch with a custom launcher job definition you need to update it to use the following container image (please refer the configuration section for details):

```
public.ecr.aws/seqera-labs/tower/nf-launcher:21.04.0
```

**4.** Update the Tower database schema by running the `/migrate-db.sh` provided in the backend container.

:::note
Make sure to include the identical environment as used in the normal backend execution.
:::

**5.** Once the schema update completes, deploy Tower following your usual procedure.
