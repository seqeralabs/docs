### Database schema

This Tower version requires a database schema update. Follow these steps
to update your DB instance and the Tower installation.

#### Kubernetes based deployment

**1.** Update the Tower container images in the Kubernetes manifest yaml files to:

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v21.02.5
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v21.02.5
```

If you are using AWS Batch with a custom launcher job definition you need to update it to use the following container image (please refer the configuration section for details):

```
public.ecr.aws/seqera-labs/tower/nf-launcher:21.04.0-edge
```

Refer to the manifests included in the Kubernetes section for details.

**2.** Update the Tower _cron_ service using the following:

```
kubectl apply -f tower-cron.yml
```

:::note
This task will automatically run the Tower database schema update tool.
:::

**3.** Update the Tower backend and frontend services using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f tower-svc.yml
```

#### Custom deployment script

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v21.02.5
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v21.02.5
```

If you are using AWS Batch with a custom launcher job definition you need to update it to use the following container image (please refer the configuration section for details):

```

```

**2.** Update the Tower database schema by running the `/migrate-db.sh` provided in the
backend container.
