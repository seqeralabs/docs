## Updating Tower deployment from version 20.10.x to 20.12.x

:::caution
If you are using the Tower API, this version Tower supports HTTP Bearer authentication. This means newly generated user access tokens should use the `Authentication: Bearer` header. HTTP Basic authentication is still supported for backwards compatibility with existing tokens, even though we suggest upgrading to the new authentication scheme. Find more details in the [Tower documentation](https://help.tower.nf/docs/api/overview/#authentication).

### Compute environments

It is now required to define the Compute environments that are to be available
to users in the Tower configuration.

The following ids options are available:

- `awsbatch-platform`: AWS Batch cloud compute service
- `gls-platform`: Google LifeSciences cloud compute service
- `lsf-platform`: IBM LSF batch scheduler
- `slurm-platform`: Slurm batch scheduler
- `k8s-platform`: Kubernetes compute platform
- `eks-platform`: AWS EKS compute platform
- `gke-platform`: Google GKE compute platform

Choose one or more of these platform ids and _append_ to your current `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS` variable, separating them via a comma.

### Database schema

This Tower version requires a database schema update. Follow these steps
to update your DB instance and the Tower installation.

#### Kubernetes based deployment

**1.** Update the Tower container images in the Kubernetes manifest yaml files to:

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v20.12.1
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v20.12.1
```

If you are using AWS Batch with a custom launcher job definition you need to update it to use the following container image (please refer the configuration section for details):

```
public.ecr.aws/e2x4u7r1/tower/nf-launcher:20.12.0-edge
```

Refer to the manifests included in the Kubernetes section for details.

**2.** Update the Tower _cron_ service using the following:

```
kubectl apply -f tower-cron.yml
```

:::note
This task will automatically run the Tower database schema update tool.
:::

**3.** Update the Tower backend and frontend services using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f tower-svc.yml
```

#### Custom deployment script

**1.** Pull or update the Tower container images references in your
deployment script(s) to:

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v20.12.1
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v20.12.1
```

If you are using AWS Batch with a custom launcher job definition you need to update it to use the following container image (please refer the configuration section for details):

```
public.ecr.aws/e2x4u7r1/tower/nf-launcher:20.12.0-edge
```

**2.** Update the Tower database schema by running the `/migrate-db.sh` provided in the
backend container.

:::note
Make sure to include the identical environment as used in the normal backend execution.
:::

**3.** Once the schema update completes, deploy Tower following your usual procedure.
