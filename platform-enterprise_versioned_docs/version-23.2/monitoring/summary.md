- Nextflow session ID
- Username of the launcher
- Work directory path

## Task status

The **Status** panel provides a real-time summary of all tasks in the pipeline run.

The possible task statuses can be described as follows:

- **pending**: the task has been created but not yet submitted to an executor
- **submitted**: the task has been submitted to an executor but is not yet running
- **running**: the task has been launched by an executor (the exact meaning of "running" may vary for each executor)
- **cached**: a previous (and valid) execution of the task was found and used instead of executing the task again
- **completed**: the task completed successfully
- **failed**: the task failed
