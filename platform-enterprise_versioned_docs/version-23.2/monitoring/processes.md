The **Processes** panel displays the status of each process in a pipeline run. In Nextflow, a _process_ is an individual step in a pipeline, while a _task_ is a particular invocation of a process for given input data. In the panel, each process is shown with a progress bar indicating how many tasks for that process have been created, submitted, completed, failed, etc.

In the example below, the fastqc process has executed four tasks, all of which completed successfully.

Selecting a process navigates to the [**Tasks table**](./tasks.mdx#tasks) and filters it by the selected process.
