## Overview

Organizations are the top-level structure and contain Workspaces, Members, Teams, and Collaborators.

### Create an organization

To create a new organization:

1. Navigate to [Your organizations](https://tower.nf/orgs) and select **Add Organization**.

2. Enter a **Name** and **Full name** for your organization.

:::caution
The organization name must follow a specific pattern. Refer to the UI for guidance.
:::

3. Enter any other optional fields as needed: **Description**, **Location**, **Website URL** and **Logo**.

4. Select **Add**.

You can view the list of all **Members**, **Teams**, and **Collaborators** in an organization on the organization's page. You can also edit any of the optional fields by selecting **Edit** from the [organizations page](https://tower.nf/orgs) or by selecting the **Settings** tab from the organization's page, provided that you are an **Owner** of the organization.

### Members

Once an organization is created, the user who created the organization is the default owner of that organization. It is also possible to invite or add other members as well.

Tower provides access control for members of an organization by classifying them either as an **Owner** or a **Member**. Each organization can have multiple owners and members.

:::note
**Owners** have full read/write access to modify members, teams, collaborators, and settings within a organization. **Members** are limited in their actions.
:::

#### Create a new member

To add a new member to an organization:

1. Go to the **Members** tab of the organization menu
2. Click on **Invite member**
3. Enter the email ID of user you'd like to add to the organization

An e-mail invitiation will be sent which needs to be accepted by the user. Once they accept the invitation, they can switch to the organization (or organization workspace) using their workspace dropdown.

### Collaborators

**Collaborators** are users who are invited to an organization's workspace, but are not members of that organization. As a result, their access is limited to only within that workspace.

New collaborators to an organization's workspace can be added using **Participants**. To learn more about the various available access levels for **Participants**, please refer to the [participant roles](./workspace-management.mdx#participant-roles) section.

:::note
**Collaborators** can only be added from a workspace. For more information, see [workspace management](./workspace-management.mdx#create-a-new-workspace).
:::

### Teams

**Teams** allow the organization **owners** to group members and collaborators together into a single unit and to manage them as a whole.

#### Create a new team

To create a new team within an organization:

1. Go to the **Teams** tab of the organization menu
2. Click on **New team**
3. Enter the **Name** of team
4. Optionally, add the **Description** and the team's **Avatar**
5. For the newly created team, click on **View**
6. Click on **Add team member** and type in the name of the organization members or collaborators
