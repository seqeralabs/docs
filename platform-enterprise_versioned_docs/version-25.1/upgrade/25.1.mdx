# Upgrade to Seqera Enterprise 25.1

To benefit from the latest fixes and enhancements, we recommend upgrading Seqera regularly.

Seqera supports the latest patch versions of the current and previous major releases (e.g., 25.x and 24.x). Upgrades must proceed one major version at a time.

Alongside standard upgrade steps, some versions may include additional tasks specific to that release.

:::warning[Version compatibility]
Seqera is backward-compatible with the previous version. As such, existing pipelines, workspaces, and studios will continue to function.

However, default values for components (such as Nextflow) may change between versions. This can require updates to specific pipeline definitions or syntax to ensure compatibility.

Please refer to the [functionality matrix](../functionality_matrix) for detailed information regarding default component versions.
:::

## Pre-upgrade Planning

The following external services are required for a deployment of Seqera Platform Enterprise:

- **Redis**: Version 7 is officially supported (minimum required version is 6.2).
- **MySQL**: Version 8 is officially supported (minimum required version is 5.7).

## Container Images

Seqera is distributed as a collection of containers available through the [Seqera container registry](https://cr.seqera.io).
To obtain access credentials, please contact [Seqera Support](https://support.seqera.io).

For production deployments, we recommend mirroring these containers to your own registry to enhance stability and reliability.

Seqera images published as part of this release are available at:

- cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v25.1.1
- cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v25.1.1
- cr.seqera.io/private/nf-tower-enterprise/migrate-db:v25.1.1

## Database Backup

Seqera version upgrades may include database schema and data modifications. Before proceeding with any upgrade, create a complete backup of your Seqera Platform database and any associated database instances.

To create a backup of your MySQL database:

```shell
backup:
> mysqldump -u root -p[root_password] [seqera_db_identifier] > seqera_backup.sql

restore:
> mysql -u root -p [seqera_db_identifier] < seqera_backup.sql
```

:::tip
- Store your backup in a secure location separate from your production environment
- Verify the backup file size and contents before proceeding with the upgrade
:::

If you're using a managed database service (such as Amazon RDS), follow your provider's recommended backup procedures. For containerized databases, ensure your volume mounts are properly configured to persist data.

## Docker Compose Configuration
