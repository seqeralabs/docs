# Upgrade to Seqera Enterprise 25.1

To benefit from the latest fixes and enhancements, we recommend upgrading Seqera regularly.

Seqera supports the latest patch versions of the current and previous major releases (e.g., 25.x and 24.x). Upgrades must proceed one major version at a time.

Alongside standard upgrade steps, some versions may include additional tasks specific to that release.

:::warning[Version compatibility]
Seqera is backward-compatible with the previous version. As such, existing pipelines, workspaces, and studios will continue to function.

However, default values for components (such as Nextflow) may change between versions. This can require updates to specific pipeline definitions or syntax to ensure compatibility.

Please refer to the [functionality matrix](../functionality_matrix) for detailed information regarding default component versions.

# Pre-upgrade Planning
