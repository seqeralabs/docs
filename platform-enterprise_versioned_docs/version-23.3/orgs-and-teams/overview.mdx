Seqera Platform simplifies the development and execution of workflows by providing a centralized interface for managing users and resources. This is achieved through the context of workspaces, which form part of organizations,

- [Organizations](../orgs-and-teams/organizations.mdx): Organizations are the top-level structure and contain workspaces, members, and teams. You can also add external collaborators to an organization.
- [User workspaces](../orgs-and-teams/workspace-management.mdx): Each user has a unique personal workspace to manage resources such as pipelines, compute environments, and credentials.
- [Organization workspaces](../orgs-and-teams/workspace-management.mdx): You can create multiple workspaces within an organization context and associate each of these workspaces with dedicated teams of users, providing fine-grained access control for each of the teams.
