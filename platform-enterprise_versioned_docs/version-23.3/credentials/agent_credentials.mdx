[Tower Agent](../supported_software/agent/agent.mdx) enables Seqera Platform to launch pipelines on HPC clusters that do not allow direct access through an SSH client. Tower Agent authenticates a secure connection with Seqera using a Tower Agent credential.

## Tower Agent sharing

You can share a single Tower Agent instance with all members of a workspace. Create a Tower Agent credential, with **Shared agent** enabled, in the relevant workspace. All workspace members can then use this credential (Connection ID + Seqera access token) to use the same Tower Agent instance.

## Create a Tower Agent credential

- From an organization workspace: Go to the **Credentials > Add Credentials**.
- From your personal workspace: From the user menu, go to **Your credentials > Add credentials**.
