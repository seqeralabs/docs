## Container registry credentials

From version 22.3, Tower supports the configuration of credentials for the Nextflow Wave container service to authenticate to private and public container registries. For more information on Wave containers, see [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/wave.html).

:::note
Container registry credentials are only leveraged by the Wave containers service. In order for your pipeline execution to leverage Wave containers, add `wave { enabled=true }` either to the **Nextflow config** field on the launch page, or to your nextflow.config file.

### Google Cloud registry access

Although Container Registry is still available and supported as a [Google Enterprise API](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-api-stability-tenets-govern-google-enterprise-apis), new features will only be available in Artifact Registry. Container Registry will only receive critical security fixes. Google recommends using Artifact Registry for all new registries moving forward.

Google Cloud Artifact Registry and Container Registry are fully integrated with Google Cloud services and support various authentication methods. Tower requires programmatic access to your private registry using [long-lived service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication#json-key) in JSON format.

Create dedicated service account keys that are only used to interact with your repositories. Tower requires the [Artifact Registry Reader](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#permissions) or [Storage Object Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control#permissions) role.

#### Create a service account

=== "Google Cloud Artifact Registry"

    Administrators can create a service account from the Google Cloud console:

    1. Navigate to the [Create service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account) page.
    2. Select a Cloud project.
    3. Enter a service account name and (optional) description.
    4. Select **Create and continue**.
    5. From the **Role** drop-down menu under step 2, select **Artifact Registry -> Artifact Registry Reader**, then select Continue.
    6. (Optional) Grant other users and admins access to this service account under step 3.
    7. Select **Done**.
    8. From the project service accounts page, select the three-dot menu button under **Actions** for the service account you just created, then select **Manage keys**.
    9. On the Keys page, select **Add key**.
    10. On the Create private key popup, select **JSON** and then **Create**. This triggers a download of a JSON file containing the service account private key and service account details.
    11. Base-64 encode the contents of the JSON key file:

    ```bash
    #Linux
    base64 KEY-FILE-NAME > NEW-KEY-FILE-NAME

    #macOS
    base64 -i KEY-FILE-NAME -o NEW-KEY-FILE-NAME

    #Windows
    Base64.exe -e KEY-FILE-NAME > NEW-KEY-FILE-NAME
    ```
