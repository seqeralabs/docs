## Updating Tower deployment from version 20.08.x to 20.10.x

### Compute environments

It is now required to define the Compute environments that are to be available to users in the Tower configuration.

The following ids options are available:

- `awsbatch-platform`: AWS Batch cloud compute service
- `gls-platform`: Google LifeSciences cloud compute service
- `lsf-platform`: IBM LSF batch scheduler
- `slurm-platform`: Slurm batch scheduler

Choose one or more of these platform ids and _append_ to your current `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS`
variable, separating them via a comma.

### Database schema

This Tower version requires a database schema update. Follow these steps
to update your DB instance and the Tower installation.

#### Kubernetes based deployment

**1.** Update the Tower container images in the Kubernetes manifest yaml files to:

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v20.10.2
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v20.10.2
```

Refer to the manifests included in the Kubernetes section for details.

**2.** Update the Tower _cron_ service using the following:

```
kubectl apply -f tower-cron.yml
```

:::note
This task will automatically run the Tower database schema update tool.
:::

**3.** Update the Tower backend and frontend services using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f tower-svc.yml
```

#### Custom deployment script

**1.** Pull or update the Tower container images references in your
deployment script(s) to:

```
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/backend:v20.10.2
195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise/frontend:v20.10.2
```

**2.** Update the Tower database schema by running the `/migrate-db.sh` provided in the
backend container.

:::note
Make sure to include the identical environment as used in the normal backend execution.
:::

**3.** Once the schema update completes, deploy Tower according to the usual procedure.
