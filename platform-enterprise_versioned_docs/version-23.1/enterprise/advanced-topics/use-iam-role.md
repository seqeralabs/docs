AWS-based customers can configure Seqera Platform to authenticate to AWS services like Batch with an IAM Role instead of IAM user credentials.

:::note
The provided policies were designed with certain assumptions:

1. **IAM Policy**: Seqera must have full access to identified S3 buckets.
2. **Trust Policy**: The Role should be assumable by EC2 or EKS (depending on your Seqera deployment), and only specifically-named IAM actors.

You may wish to limit S3 access to specific prefixes, and/or Role assumption to more specific platforms.
:::

## Configure the Seqera IAM policy

1. Download the [custom IAM Policy](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-aws/blob/master/forge/forge-policy.json).
1. Download the [S3 bucket write policy](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-aws/blob/master/launch/s3-bucket-write.json).
1. Modify the S3 bucket write policy by adding `"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME"` for each bucket that will be used as a pipeline work directory. 
1. Revise the scope of access to a specific prefix in the S3 buckets, if needed (modify `"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"`).

## Modify the Seqera IAM role trust policy (optional)

You can optionally create a Seqera role trust policy to allow EC2 instances or EKS clusters (depending on your Seqera deployment) to assume the Seqera IAM role.

1. Download the [Seqera IAM role trust policy](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-aws/blob/master/launch/seqera-role-trust-policy.json).
1. Replace `YOUR-AWS-ACCOUNT` with your AWS Account ID.
1. Replace `USER-OR-ROLE/USER-OR-ROLE-ID` with the users and or roles that must be able to assume the Seqera IAM role. 

## Create the IAM artifacts

[Create the IAM artifacts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in your AWS account.

1. Navigate to the folder containing your configured IAM documents:

   ```bash
   cd <FOLDER_WITH_YOUR_CONFIGURED_IAM_DOCUMENTS>
   ```

2. Create the **Role**:

   ```bash
   aws iam create-role --role-name Seqera-Role --assume-role-policy-document file://Seqera-Role-Trust-Policy.json
   ```

3. Create an **inline policy** for the Role:

   ```bash
   aws iam put-role-policy --role-name Seqera-Role --policy-name Seqera-Role-Policy --policy-document file://Seqera-Role-Policy.json
   ```

4. Create an **instance profile**:

   ```bash
   aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name Seqera-Instance
   ```

5. **Bind** the Role to the instance profile:

   ```bash
   aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name Seqera-Instance --role-name Seqera-Role
   ```

## Configure Seqera

With the IAM artifacts created, update your application configuration:

1. Add the following entry to your `tower.env`

   ```env
   TOWER_ALLOW_INSTANCE_CREDENTIALS=true
   ```

2. Restart the Seqera application.

3. Verify that the change took effect by querying the Seqera instance `service-info` endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://YOUR-TOWER-DOMAIN/api/service-info" -H "Accept: application/json" | jq ".serviceInfo.allowInstanceCredentials"
   ```

4. Log in to Seqera and create a new AWS credential. You are now prompted for an AWS `arn` instead of access keys.
