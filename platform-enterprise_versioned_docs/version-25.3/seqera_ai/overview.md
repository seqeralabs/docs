Seqera AI is an AI-powered assistant for pipeline development, debugging, and optimization, which has read and write access to Seqera Platform. This enables Seqera AI to directly interact with Seqera Platform primitives to debug pipelines, modify parameters, and launch runs, all without switching context between different tools and interfaces.
