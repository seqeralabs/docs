Studios is a unified platform where you can host a combination of container images and compute environments for interactive analysis using your preferred tools, like JupyterLab, an R-IDE, Visual Studio Code IDEs, or Xpra remote desktops. Each Studio session is an individual interactive environment that encapsulates the live environment for dynamic data analysis.

:::note
Studios in Enterprise is not enabled by default. You can enable Studios in the [environment variables configuration](../enterprise/studios).
:::

- [Deploy Studios in Seqera Platform](../enterprise/studios): Enable Studios as part of your Seqera Platform Enterprise instance.
- [Add Studios](./add-studio): Understand the configuration options for creating, running, and customizing Studio sessions.
- [Manage Studios](./managing): Manage your Studios and how collaborators use them.
- [Container images](./container-images): Learn about the container image templates provided: JupyterLab, R-IDE, Visual Studio Code, and Xpra.
- [Custom environments](./custom-envs): Augument the Seqera-provided images with a list of Conda packages or by providing your own base container template image.

:::note
Currently, Studios supports [AWS Cloud][aws-cloud], [Google Cloud][google-cloud], and [AWS Batch][aws-batch] compute environments that **do not** have Fargate enabled.
