[Tower Agent](../agent.mdx) enables Tower to launch pipelines on HPC clusters that do not allow direct access through an SSH client. Tower Agent authenticates a secure connection with Tower using a Tower Agent credential.

### Tower Agent sharing

You can share a single Tower Agent instance with all members of a workspace. Create a Tower Agent credential, with **Shared agent** enabled, in the relevant workspace. All workspace members can then use this Tower Agent credential (Connection ID + Tower access token) to use the same Tower Agent instance.

### Create a Tower Agent credential

- From an organization workspace: navigate to the Credentials tab and select **Add Credentials**.

- From your personal workspace: select **Your credentials** from the user top-right menu, then select **Add credentials**.
