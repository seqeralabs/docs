## Overview

Nextflow Tower simplifies the development and execution of workflows by providing a centralized interface for managing users and resources, while providing ready-to-launch workflows for users. This is achieved through the context of [workspaces](../getting-started/workspace).

### Organization resources

Tower allows the creation of multiple organizations, each of which can contain multiple workspaces with shared users and resources. This allows any organization to customize and organize the usage of resources while maintaining an access control layer for users associated with a workspace.

- For further information on organizations, see [Organizations](./organizations).

- For further information on organization workspaces, see [Workspace management](./workspace-management).

### Organization users

Any user can be added or removed from an organization or workspace and can be allocated a specific access role within that workspace.

Teams provide a way for organizations to group users and participants together into teams, such as `workflow-developers` or `analysts`, and apply access control for all users within this team.

For further information on user and team creation, see [User management](./organizations#Members).
