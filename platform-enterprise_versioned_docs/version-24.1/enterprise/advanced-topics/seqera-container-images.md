:::caution
The Seqera container registry `cr.seqera.io` is the default Tower container image registry from version 22.4. AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Tower image registries in existing installations are still supported but are deprecated for **new installations** from June 2023.

???+ example "Legacy Tower image instructions"

    === "AWS"
        Seqera publishes legacy Tower Enterprise containers to a private Elastic Container Registry (ECR) on AWS. Retrieve them with the following steps:

        1. **Provide Seqera with your AWS Account ID.**

            Supply this value to the Seqera representative managing your onboarding and wait for confirmation that it has been added to the ECR repository policy as an approved Principal.

        2. **Retrieve a local copy of the container.**

            With the `docker compose` deployment method, you must retrieve container copies for local use:

            1. Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) on the target machine.

            2. Configure the AWS CLI with an IAM User with at least these privileges:

                ```bash
                ecr:BatchGetImage
                ecr:GetAuthorizationToken
                ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer
                ```
            3. Authenticate Docker against the Seqera ECR:

                ```bash
                # AWS CLI v2
                aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-1 | \
                docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

                # AWS CLI v1
                $(aws ecr get-login --registry-ids 195996028523 --region eu-west-1 --no-include-email)
                ```

            4. Pull the containers to your machine:

                ```bash
                export REPOSITORY_URL="195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nf-tower-enterprise"
                export TAG="v22.3.1"

                docker pull ${REPOSITORY_URL}/backend:${TAG}
                docker pull ${REPOSITORY_URL}/frontend:${TAG}
                ```

    === "Azure"
        Seqera publishes legacy Tower Enterprise containers to a private Azure Container Registry instance. Retrieve them with the following steps:

        1. **Acquire credentials from Seqera.**

            If you chose to retrieve your Tower Enterprise containers from Seqera's Azure Container Registry, you were supplied with a user ID and authentication token during the onboarding process.

        2. **Retrieve a local copy of the container.**

            With the `docker compose` deployment method, you must retrieve container copies for local use:

            a. Authenticate Docker against the Seqera Azure Container Registry:

            ```bash
            # Replace USER and TOKEN with the credentials supplied by Seqera Labs
            docker login -u USER -p TOKEN seqera.azurecr.io
            ```

            b. Pull the containers to your local instance:

            ```bash
            export REPOSITORY_URL="seqera.azurecr.io/nf-tower-enterprise"
            export TAG="v22.3.1"

            docker pull ${REPOSITORY_URL}/backend:${TAG}
            docker pull ${REPOSITORY_URL}/frontend:${TAG}
            ```

    === "Google Cloud"
        Seqera publishes legacy Tower Enterprise containers to a private Artifact Registry (AR) on GCP. Retrieve them with the following steps:

        5. **Provide Labs with your GCP Service Account.**

            Supply your GCP Project's Service Account email address to the Seqera representative managing your onboarding and wait for confirmation that it has been added as an approved Artifact Registry Reader.

        6. **Retrieve a local copy of the container.**

            With the `docker compose` deployment method, you must retrieve container copies for local use:

            a. [Install gcloud CLI and Docker](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/store-docker-container-images) on the target machine.

            b. [Authenticate the Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account) with the gcloud CLI.

            c. [Configure Docker](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication#gcloud-helper) to interact with the GCP Region where the Seqera AR resides:

            ```bash
            gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev
            ```
            d. Confirm you have access to the repository:

            ```bash
            gcloud artifacts docker images list europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/nf-tower-enterprise/containers/ --include-tags
            ```
            e. Pull the containers to your machine:

            ```bash
            export REPOSITORY_URL="europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/nf-tower-enterprise/containers"
            export TAG="v22.3.1"

            docker pull ${REPOSITORY_URL}/backend:${TAG}
            docker pull ${REPOSITORY_URL}/frontend:${TAG}
            ```

:::caution
If you're unable to pull container images due to a _denied: Permission "artifactregistry.repositories.downloadArtifacts" denied on resource "projects/nf-tower-enterprise/locations/europe-west2/repositories/containers" (or it may not exist)_ error, try the following:

            1. If your Docker requires sudo, [add sudo](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication#gcloud-helper) to the `gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev` command.

            2. If you installed Docker onto Ubuntu using `snap`, ensure your [containerd config](https://jhartman.pl/2022/03/23/how-to-fix-permission-artifactregistry-repositories-downloadartifacts-denied-on-resource-on-ubuntu-when-pulling-from-google-artifact-repository/) is properly updated.
