Select a **primary** compute environment to be used by default in a workspace. You can override the workspace primary compute environment by explicitly specifying an alternative compute environment when you create or launch a pipeline.

Command:

```bash
tw compute-envs primary set --name=my_aws_ce
```

Example output:

```bash
Primary compute environment for workspace 'user' was set to 'my_aws_ce (1sxCxvxfx8xnxdxGxQxqxH)'
```
