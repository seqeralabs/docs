Run `tw runs labels -h` to view all the required and optional fields for managing labels for runs in a workspace.

In the example below, we add the labels `test` and `rnaseq-demo` to the run with ID `5z4AMshti4g0GK`:

```bash
tw runs labels -i 5z4AMshti4g0GK test,rnaseq-demo

'set' labels on 'run' with id '5z4AMshti4g0GK' at 34830707738561 workspace
```
