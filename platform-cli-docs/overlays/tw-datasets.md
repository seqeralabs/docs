[Datasets](../data/datasets) are CSV (comma-separated values) and TSV (tab-separated values) files stored in a workspace, used as inputs during pipeline execution. The most commonly used datasets for Nextflow pipelines are samplesheets, where each row consists of a sample, the location of files for that sample (such as FASTQ files), and other sample details.
