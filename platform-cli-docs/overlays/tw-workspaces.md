Run `tw workspaces -h` to view supported workspace operations.

Workspaces provide the context in which a user launches workflow executions, defines the available resources, and manages who can access those resources. Workspaces contain pipelines, runs, actions, datasets, compute environments, credentials, and secrets. Access permissions are controlled with participants, collaborators, and teams.

See [User workspaces][user-workspaces] for more information.
